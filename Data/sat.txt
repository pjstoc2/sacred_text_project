This book was written because, with very few exceptions, every tract and paper, every 
"secret" grimoire, all the "great works" on the subject of magic, are nothing more than 
sanctimonious fraud - guilt- ridden ramblings and esoteric gibberish by chroniclers of magical 
lore unable or unwilling to present an objective view of the subject. Writer after writer, in 
efforts to state the principles of "white and black magic", has succeeded instead in clouding 
the entire issue so badly that the would-be student of sorcery winds up stupidly pushing a 
planchette over a Ouija board, standing inside a pentagram waiting for a demon to present 
itself, limply tossing I-Ching yarrow stalks like so many stale pretzels, shuffling pasteboards 
to foretell a future which has lost any meaning, attending seminars guaranteed to flatten his 
ego - while doing the same to his wallet - and in general making a blithering fool of himself in 
the eyes of those who know! 

The true magus knows that occult bookshelves abound with the brMe relics of frightened 
minds and sterile bodies, metaphysical journals of self-deceit, and constipated rule -books of 
Eastern mysticism. Far too long has the subject of Satanic magic and philosophy been written 
down by wild-eyed journalists of the right-hand path. 

The old literature is the by-product of brains festering with fear and defeat, written 
unknowingly for the assistance of those who really mle the earth, and who, from their Hellish 
thrones, laugh with noisome mirth. 

The flames of Hell bum brighter for the kindling supplied by these volumes of hoary 
misinformation and false prophecy. 

Herein you will find truth - and fantasy. Each is necessary for the other to exist; but each must 
be recognized for what it is. What you see may not always please you; but you will see! 

Here is Satanic thought from a truly Satanic point of view. 




The Church of Satan 

San Francisco, Walpurgisnacht 1968 



PROLOGUE 



The gods of the right-hand path have bickered and quarreled for an entire age of earth. Each 
of these deities and their respective priests and ministers have attempted to find wisdom in 
their own lies. The ice age of religious thought can last but a limited time in this great scheme 
of human existence. The gods of wisdom- defiled have had their saga, and their millerinium 
hath become as reality. Each, with his own "divine" path to paradise, hath accused the other of 
heresies and spiritual indiscretions. The Ring of the Nibelungen doth carry an everlasting 
curse, but only because those who seek it think in terms of "Good" and "Evil" - themselves 
being at all times "Good". The gods of the past have become as their own devils in order to 
live. Feebly, their ministers play the devil's game to fill their tabernacles and pay the 
mortgages on their temples. Alas, too long have they studied "righteousness", and poor and 
incompetent devils they make. So they all join hands in "brotherly" unity, and in their 
desperation go to Valhalla for their last great ecumenical council. "Draweth near in the gloom 
the twilight of the gods." The ravens of night have flown forth to summon Loki, who hath set 
Valhalla aflame with the searing trident of the Inferno. The twilight is done. A glow of new 
light is borne out of the night and Lucifer is risen, once more to proclaim: "This is the age of 
Satan! Satan Rules the Earth!" The gods of the unjust are dead. This is the morning of magic, 
and undefiled wisdom. The flesh prevaileth and a great Church shall be builded, consecrated 
in its name. No longer shall man's salvation be dependent on his self-denial. And it will be 
known that the world of the flesh and the living shall be the greatest preparation for any and 
all eternal delights! 

REGIE SATANAS! 
AVE SATANAS! 



HAIL SATAN!

THE BOOK OF SATAN 

THE INFERNAL DIATRIBE 

The first book of the Satanic Bible is not an attempt to blaspheme as much as it is a statement 
of what might be termed "diabolical indignation". The Devil has been attacked by the men of 
God relentlessly and without reservation. Never has there been an opportunity, short of 
fiction, for the Dark Prince to speak out in the same manner as the spokesmen of the Lord of 
the Righteous. The pulpit- pounders of the past have been free to define "good" and "evil" as 
they see fit, and have gladly smashed into oblivion any who disagree with their lies - both 
verbally and, at times, physically. Their talk of "charity", when applied to His Infernal 
Majesty, becomes an empty sham - and most unfairly, too, considering the obvious fact that 
without their Satanic foe their very religions would collapse. How sad, that the allegorical 
personage most responsible for the success of spiritual religions is shown the least amount of 
charity and the most consistent abuse - and by those who most unctuously preach the rules of 
fair play! For all the centuries of shouting- down the Devil has received, he has never shouted 
back at his detractors. He has remained the gentleman at all times, while those he supports 
rant and rave. He has shown himself to be a model of deportment, but now he feels it is time 
to shout back. He has decided it is finally time to receive his due. Now the ponderous rule- 
books of hypocrisy are no longer needed. In order to relearn the Law of the Jungle, a small, 
slim diatribe will do. Each verse is an inferno. Each word is a tongue of fire. The flames of 
Hell bum fierce . . . and purify! Read on and learn the Law.

SATAN 

I 

1 . In this arid wilderness of steel and stone I raise up my voice that you may hear. To the 
East and to the West I beckon. To the North and to the South I show a sign 
proclaiming: Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong! 

2. Open your eyes that you may see, Oh men of mildewed minds, and listen to me ye 
bewildered millions! 

3. For I stand forth to challenge the wisdom of the world; to interrogate the "laws" of 
man and of "God"! 

4. I request reason for your golden rule and ask the why and wherefore of your ten 
commandments. 

5. Before none of your printed idols do I bend in acquiescence, and he who saith "thou 
shalt" to me is my mortal foe! 

6. I dip my forefinger in the watery blood of your impotent mad redeemer, and write 
over his thorn- torn brow: The true prince of evil - the king of slaves! 

7. No hoary falsehood shall be a truth to me; no stifling dogma shall encramp my pen! 

8. I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly success and 
happiness. 

9. I raise up in stem invasion the standard of the strong! 

10. 1 gaze into the glassy eye of your fearsome Jehovah, and pluck him by the beard; I 

uplift a broad- axe, and split open his worm-eaten skull! 
1 1 . 1 blast out the ghastly contents of philosophically whited sepulchers and laugh with 

sardonic wrath! 



THE 
BOOK OF 

SATAN 

II 

1 . Behold the crucifix; what does it symbolize? Pallid incompetence hanging on a tree. 

2. I question all things. As I stand before the festering and varnished facades of your 
haughtiest moral dogmas, I write thereon in letters of blazing scorn: Lo and behold; all 
this is fraud! 

3. Gather around me, Oh! ye death- defiant, and the earth itself shall be thine, to have and 
to hold! 

4. Too long the dead hand has been permitted to sterilize living thought! 

5 . Too long right and wrong, good and evil have been inverted by false prophets ! 

6. No creed must be accepted upon authority of a "divine" nature. Religions must be put 
to the question. No moral dogma must be taken for granted - no standard of 
measurement deified. There is nothing inherently sacred about moral codes. Like the 
wooden idols of long ago, they are the work of human hands, and what man has made, 
man can destroy! 

7. He that is slow to believe anything and everything is of great understanding, for belief 
in one false principle is the begiririing of all unwisdom. 

8. The chief duty of every new age is to upraise new men to determine its liberties, to 
lead it towards material success - to rend the rusty padlocks and chains of dead custom 
that always prevent healthy expansion. Theories and ideas that may have meant life 
and hope and freedom for our ancestors may now mean destruction, slavery, and 
dishonor to us! 

9. As environments change, no human ideal standeth sure! 

10. Whenever, therefore, a he has built unto itself a throne, let it be assailed without pity 
and without regret, for under the domination of an inconvenient falsehood, no one can 
prosper. 

1 1 . Let established sophisms be dethroned, rooted out, burnt and destroyed, for they are a 
standing menace to all true nobility of thought and action! 

12. Whatever alleged "truth" is proven by results to be but an empty fiction, let it be 
unceremoniously flung into the outer darkness, among the dead gods, dead empires, 
dead philosophies, and other useless lumber and wreckage! 

13. The most dangerous of all enthroned lies is the holy, the sanctified, the privileged he - 
the he everyone believes to be a model truth. It is the fruitful mother of all other 
popular errors and delusions. It is a hydra-headed tree of unreason with a thousand 
roots. It is a social cancer! 

14. The he that is known to be a he is half eradicated, but the he that even intelligent 
persons accept as fact - the he that has been inculcated in a hide child at its mother's 
knee - is more dangerous to contend against than a creeping pestilence! 

15. Popular lies have ever been the most potent enemies of personal liberty. There is only 
one way to deal with them: Cut them out, to the very core, just as cancers. Exteiminate 
them root and branch. Aririihilate them, or they will us!

SATAN 



III 

1. "Love one another" it has been said is the supreme law, but what power made it so? 
Upon what rational authority does the gospel of love rest? Why should I not hate mine 
enemies - if I "love" them does that not place me at their mercy? 

2. Is it natural for enemies to do good unto each other - and what is good? 

3 . Can the torn and bloody victim "love" the blood- splashed jaws that rend him limb 
from limb? 

4. Are we not all predatory animals by instinct? If humans ceased wholly from preying 
upon each other, could they continue to exist? 

5. Is not "lust and carnal desire" a more truthful term to describe "love" when applied to 
the continuance of the race? Is not the "love" of the fawning scriptures simply a 
euphemism for sexual activity, or was the "great teacher" a glorifier of eunuchs? 

6. Love your enemies and do good to them that hate and use you - is this not the 
despicable philosophy of the spaniel that rolls upon its back when kicked? 

7. Hate your enemies with a whole heart, and if a man smite you on one cheek, smash him 
on the other!; smite him hip and thigh, for self-preservation is the highest law! 

8 . He who turns the other cheek is a cowardly dog ! 

9. Give blow for blow, scorn for scorn, doom for doom - with compound interest 
liberally added thereunto! Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, aye four- fold, a hundred- fold! 
Make yourself a Terror to your adversary, and when he goeth his way, he will possess 
much additional wisdom to ruminate over. Thus shall you make yourself respected in 
all the walks of life, and your spirit - your immortal spirit - shall live, not in an 
intangible paradise, but in the brains and sinews of those whose respect you have 
gained.

1 . Life is the great indulgence - death, the great abstinence. Therefore, make the most of 

life - HERE AND NOW ! 

2. There is no heaven of glory bright, and no hell where sinners roast. Here and now is 
our day of torment! Here and now is our day of joy! Here and now is our opportunity! 
Choose ye this day, this hour, for no redeemer liveth! 

3. Say unto thine own heart, "I am mine own redeemer." 

4. Stop the way of them that would persecute you. Let those who devise thine undoing be 
hurled back to confusion and infamy. Let them be as chaff before the cyclone and after 
they have fallen rejoice in thine own salvation. 

5. Then all thy bones shall say pridefully, "Who is like unto me? Have I not been too 
strong for mine adversaries? Have I not delivered myself by mine own brain and

(AIR) 



THE BOOK OF LUCIFER 

THE ENLIGHTENMENT 

The Roman god, Lucifer, was the bearer of light, the spirit of the air, the personification of 
enlightenment. In Christian mythology he became synonymous with evil, which was only to 
have been expected from a religion whose very existence is perpetuated by clouded 
definitions and bogus values! It is time to set the record straight. False moralisms and occult 
inaccuracies must be corrected. Entertaining as they might be, most stories and plays about 
Devil worship must be recognized as the obsolete absurdities they are. It has been said "the 
truth will make men free". The truth alone has never set anyone free. It is only doubt which 
will bring mental emancipation. Without the wonderful element of doubt, the doorway 
through which truth passes would be tightiy shut, impervious to the most strenuous poundings 
of a thousand Lucifers. How understandable that Holy Scripture should refer to the Infernal 
monarch as the "father of lies" - a magnificent example of character inversion. If one is to 
believe this theological accusation that the Devil represents falsehood, then it surely must be 
concurred that it was he, not god, that established all spiritual religions and who wrote all of the 
holy bibles ! When one doubt is followed by another, the bubble, grown large from long 
accumulated fallacies, threatens to burst. For those who already doubt supposed truths, this 
book is revelation. Then Lucifer will have risen. Now is the time for doubt! The bubble of 
falsehood is bursting and its sound is the roar of the world! 



-WANTED!- 

GOD 
DEAD OR ALIVE 



It is a popular misconception that the Satanist does not believe in God. The concept of 

f"God", as interpreted by man, has been so varied throughout the ages, that the Satanist 
simply accepts the definition which suits him best. Man has always created his gods, 
rather than his gods creating him. God is, to some, benign - to others, terrifying. To the 
Satanist "God" - by whatever name he is called, or by no name at all - is seen as the 
balancing factor in nature, and not as being concerned with suffering. This powerful 
force which permeates and balances the universe is far too impersonal to care about the 
happiness or misery of flesh- and-blood creatures on this ball of dirt upon which we 



live. 



Anyone who tliinks of Satan as evil should consider all the men, women, children, and 
animals who have died because it was "God's will". Certainly a person grieving the untimely 
loss of a loved one would much rather have their loved one with them than in God's hands! 
Instead, they are unctuously consoled by their clergyman who says, "It was God's will, my 
dear"; or "He is in God's hands now, my son." Such phrases have been a convenient way for 
religionists to condone or excuse the mercilessness of God. But if God is in complete control 
and as benign as he is supposed to be, why does He allow these things to happen? Too long 
have religionists been falling back on their bibles and rulebooks to prove or disprove, justify, 
condemn, or interpret. 

The Satanist realizes that man, and the action and reaction of the universe, is responsible for 
everything, and doesn't mislead himself into thinking that someone cares. No longer will we 
sit back and accept "fate" without doing anything about it, just because it says so in Chapter 
such and such, Psalm so and so - and that's that! The Satanist knows that praying does 
absolutely no good - in fact, it actually lessens the chance of success, for the devoutly 
religious too often sit back complacently and pray for a situation which, if they were to do 
something about it on their own, could be accomplished much quicker! 

The Satanist shuns terms such as "hope" and "prayer" as they are indicative of apprehension. 
If we hope and pray for something to come about, we will not act in a positive way which will 
make it happen. The Satanist, realizing that anything he gets is of his own doing, takes 
command of the situation instead of praying to God for it to happen. Positive minking and 
positive action add up to results. 

Just as the Satanist does not pray to God for assistance, he does not pray for forgiveness for 
his wrong doings. In other religions, when one commits a wrong he either prays to God for 
forgiveness, or confesses to an intermediary and asks him to pray to God for forgiveness for 
his sins. The Satanist knows that praying does no good, confessing to another human being, 
like himself, accomplishes even less - and is, furthermore, degrading. 

When a Satanist commits a wrong, he realizes that it is natural to make a mistake - and if he is 
truly sorry about what he has done, he will learn from it and take care not to do the same thing 
again. If he is not honestiy sorry about what he has done, and knows he will do the same thing 
over and over, he has no business confessing and asking forgiveness in the first place. But this 
is exactiy what happens. People confess their sins so that they can clear their consciences - 
and be free to go out and sin again, usually the same sin. 



and be free to go out and sin again, usually the same sin. 

There are many different interpretations of God, in the usual sense of the word, as there are 
types of people. The images run from a belief in a god who is some vague sort of "universal 
cosmic mind" to an anthropomorphic deity with a long white beard and sandals who keeps 
track of every action of each individual. 

Even within the confines of a given religion, the personal interpretations of God differ greatiy. 
Some religions actually go so far as to label anyone who belongs to a religious sect other than 
their own a heretic, even though the overall doctrines and impressions of godliness are nearly 
the same. For example: The Catholics believe that the Protestants are doomed to Hell simply 
because they do not belong to the Catholic Church. In the same way, many splinter groups of 
the Christian faith, such as the evangelical or revivalist churches, believe that the Catholics 
are heathens who worship graven images. (Christ is depicted in the image that is most 
psychologically akin to the individual worshipping him, and yet the Christians criticize 
"heathens" for the worship of graven images.) And the Jews have always been given the 
Devil's name. 

Even though the god in all of these religions is basically the same, each regards the way 
chosen by the others as reprehensible, and to top it all, religionists actually pray for one 
another! They have scorn for the brothers of the right-hand path because their religions carry 
different labels, and somehow this animosity must be released. What better way than through 
"prayer" ! What a simperingly polite way of saying: "I hate your guts," is the thinly disguised 
device known as praying for your enemy! Praying for one's own enemy is nothing more than 
bargain-basement anger, and of a decidedly shoddy and inferior quality! 

If there has been so much violent discrepancy as to the proper way in which to worship God, 
how many different interpretations of God can there be - and who is right? 

All devout "white- lighters" are concerned with pleasing God so that they might have the 
"Pearly Gates" opened for them when they die. Nevertheless, if a man has not lived his life in 
accordance with the regulations of his faith, he can at the last minute call a clergyman to his 
deathbed for a final absolution. The priest or minister will then come running on the double, 
to "make everything right" with God and see to it that his passport to the Heavenly Realm is 
in order. (The Yezidis, a sect of Devil worshippers, take a different viewpoint. They believe 
that God is all-powerful, but also all- forgiving, and so accordingly feel that it is the Devil 
whom they must please, as he is the one who rules their lives while here on earth. They 
believe so strongly that God will forgive all of their sins once they have been given the last 
rites, that they feel no need to concern themselves with the opinion God may hold of them 
while they live.) 

With all of the contradictions in the Christian scriptures, many people currently cannot 
rationally accept Christianity the way it has been practiced in the past. Great numbers of 
people are beginning to doubt the existence of God, in the established Christian sense of the 
word. So, they have taken to calling themselves "Christian Atheists". True, the Christian Bible 
is a mass of contradictions; but what could be more contradictory than the term "Christian 
Atheist"? 

If prominent leaders of the Christian faith are rejecting the past interpretations of God, how 
then can their followers be expected to adhere to previous religious tradition? 



With all the debates about whether or not God is dead, if he isn't he had better have medicare! 



jSa religions of a spiritual nature are inventions of man. He has created an entire 

system of gods with nothing more than his carnal brain. Just because he has an ego, 
Jm and cannot accept it, he has to externalize it into some great spiritual device which he 
/ calls "God". 

\ God can do all the things man is forbidden to do - such as kill people, perform miracles 
J to gratify his will, control without any apparent responsibility, etc. If man needs such a 
god and recognizes that god, then he is worshipping an entity that a human being 
invented. Therefore, he is worshipping by proxy the man that invented god. Is it not more sensible to 
worship a god that he, himself, has created, in accordance with his own emotional needs - one 
that best represents the very carnal and physical being that has the idea- power to invent a god 
in the first place? 

If man insists on externalizing his true self in the form of "God", then why fear his true self, in 
fearing "God", - why praise his true self in praising "God", - why remain externalized from 

"God" IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN RITUAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IN HIS NAME? 

Man needs ritual and dogma, but no law states that an externalized god is necessary in order 
to engage in ritual and ceremony performed in a god's name! Could it be that when he closes 
the gap between himself and his "God" he sees the demon of pride creeping forth - that very 
embodiment of Lucifer appearing in his midst? He no longer can view himself in two parts, 
the carnal and the spiritual, but sees them merge as one, and then to his abysmal horror, 
discovers that they are only the carnal - and always were! Then he either hates himself to death, 
day by day - or rejoices that he is what he is! 

If he hates himself, he searches out new and more complex spiritual paths of "enlightenment" 
in hopes that he may split himself up again in his quest for stronger and more externalized 
"gods" to scourge his poor miserable shell. If he accepts himself, but recognizes that ritual and 
ceremony are the important devices that his invented religions have utilized to sustain his 
faith in a lie, then it is the same form of ritual that will sustain his faith in the truth - the 
primitive pageantry that will give his awareness of his own majestic being added substance. 

When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and 
farther from "God"; closer to the "Devil." If this is what the devil represents, and a man lives 
his life in the devil's fane, with the sinews of Satan moving in his flesh, then he either escapes 
from the cackhngs and carpings of the righteous, or stands proudly in his secret places of the 
earth and manipulates the folly- ridden masses through his own Satanic might, until that day 
when he may come forth in splendor proclaiming "i am a satanist! bow down, for i am the highest 

EMBODIMENT OF HUMAN LIFE!" 



THE GOD YOU SAVE 
MAY BE YOURSELF 




SOME EVIDENCE OF 
A NEW SATANIC AGE 



a The seven deadly sins of the Christian Church are: greed, pride, envy, anger, 

gluttony, lust, and sloth. Satanism advocates indulging in each of these "sins" as they 
W all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification. 

9 A Satanist knows there is nothing wrong with being greedy, as it only means that he 
\ wants more than he already has. Envy means to look with favor upon the possessions 
J of others, and to be desirous of obtaining similar things for oneself. Envy and greed are 
the motivating forces of ambition - and without ambition, very lMe of any importance 
would be accomplished. 

Gluttony is simply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive. When you have 
overeaten to the point of obesity, another sin - pride - will motivate you to regain an 
appearance that will renew your self-respect. 

Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other than covering his body and 
protecting it from the elements is guilty of pride. Satanists often encounter scoffers who 
maintain that labels are not necessary. It must be pointed out to these destroyers of labels that 
one or many articles they themselves are wearing are not wearing are not necessary to keep 
them warm. There is not a person on this earth who is completely devoid of ornamentation. 
The Satanist points out that any ornamentation of the scoffer's body shows that he, too, is 
guilty of pride. Regardless of how verbose the cynic may be in his intellectual description of 
how free he is, he is still wearing the elements of pride. 

Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth, and if you he in bed long 
enough you may find yourself committing yet another sin - lust. To have the faintest stirring of 
sexual desire is to be guilty of lust. In order to insure the propagation of humanity, nature 
made lust the second most powerful instinct, the first being self-preservation. Realizing this, 
the Christian Church made fornication the "Original Sin". In this way they made sure no one 
would escape sin. Your very state of being is as a result of sin - the Original sin! 

The strongest instinct in every living thing is self-preservation, which brings us to the last of 
the seven deadly sins - anger. Is it not our instinct for self-preservation that is aroused when 
someone harms us, when we become angry enough to protect ourselves from further attack? 
A Satanist practices the motto, "If a man smite thee on one cheek, smash him on the other!" 
Let no wrong go unredressed. Be as a lion in the path - be dangerous even in defeat! 

Since man's natural instincts lead him to sin, all men are sinners; and all sinners go to hell. If 
everyone goes to hell, then you will meet all your friends there. Heaven must be populated 
with some rather strange creatures if they all lived for was to go to a place where they can 
strum harps for eternity. 

"Times have changed. Religious leaders no longer preach that all our natural actions are 
sinful. We no longer think sex is dirty - or that taking pride in ourselves is shameful - or that 
wanting something someone else has is vicious." Of course not, times have changed! "If you 
want proof of this, just look at how liberal churches have become. Why, they're practicing all 
the things that you preach." 



Satanists hear these, and similar statements, all the time; and they agree wholeheartedly, but, 
if the world has changed so much, why continue to grasp at the threads of a dying faith? If 
many religions are denying their own scriptures because they are out of date, and are 
preaching the philosophies of Satanism, why not call it by its rightful name - Satanism? 
Certainly it would be far less hypocritical. 

In recent years there has been an attempt to humanize the spiritual concept of Christianity. 
This has manifested itself in the most obvious non- spiritual means. Masses which had been 
said in Latin are now said in native languages - which only succeeds in making the nonsense 
easier to understand, and at the same time robs the ceremony of the esoteric nature which is 
consistent with the tenets of the dogma. It is much simpler to obtain an emotional reaction 
using words and phrases that cannot be understood than it is with statements which even the 
simplest mind will question when hearing them in an understandable language. 

If priests and ministers were to have used the devices to fill their churches one hundred years 
ago that they use today, they would have been charged with heresy, called devils, oft-times 
persecuted, but certainly excommunicated without hesitation. 

The religionists wail, "We must keep up with the times," forgetting that, due to limiting 
factors and deeply engrained laws of white light religions, there can never be sufficient 
change to meet the needs of man. 

Past religions have always represented the spiritual nature of man, with little or no concern for 
his carnal or mundane needs. They have considered this life but transitory, and the flesh 
merely a shell; physical pleasure trivial, and pain a worthwhile preparation for the "Kingdom 
of God". How well the utter hypocrisy comes forth when the "righteous" make a change in 
their religion to keep up with man's natural change! The only way that Christianity can ever 
completely serve the needs of man is to become as Satanism is now. 

It has become necessary for a new religion, based on man's natural instincts, to come forth. 
they have named it. It is called Satanism. It is that power condemned that has caused the 
religious controversy over birth-control measures - a disgruntled admission that sexual 
activity, for fun, is here to stay. 

It is the "Devil" who caused women to show their legs, to titillate men - the same kind of legs, 
now socially acceptable to gaze upon, which are revealed by young nuns as they walk about 
in their shortened habits. What a delightful step in the right (or left) direction! Is it possible 
we will soon see "topless" nuns sensually throwing their bodies about to the "Missa Solemnis 
Rock"? Satan smiles and says he would like that fine - many nuns are very pretty girls with 
nice legs. 

Many churches with some of the largest congregations have the most hand- clapping, sensual 
music - also Satanically inspired. After all, the Devil has always had the best tunes. 

Church picnics, despite all of Aunt Martha's talk about the Lord's Bountiful Harvest, are 
nothing more than a good excuse for Sunday gluttony; and everyone knows that lots more 
than Bible reading goes on in the bushes. 

The fund-raising adjunct to many church bazaars is commonly known as a carnival, which 
used to mean the celebration of the flesh; now a carnival is okay because the money goes to 
the church so that it can preach against the temptations of the Devil! It will be said that these 



things are only pagan devices and ceremonies - that the Christians borrowed them. True, but 
the Pagans reveled in the delights of the flesh, and were condemned by the very same people 
who celebrate their rituals, but call them by different names. 

Priests and ministers are in the front lines of peace demonstrations, and lying on railroad 
tracks in front of trains carrying war materials, with as much dedication as their brothers of 
the cloth, from the same seminaries, who are blessing the bullets and bombs and fighting men 
as chaplains in the armed forces. Someone must be wrong, someplace. Could it be that Satan 
is the one qualified to act as accuser? Certainly they named him that! 

When a puppy reaches maturity it becomes a dog; when ice melts it is called water; when 
twelve months have been used up, we get a new calendar with the proper chronological name; 
when "magic" becomes scientific fact we refer to it as medicine, astronomy, etc. When one 
name is no longer appropriate for a given thing it is only logical to change it to a new one 
which better fits the subject. Why, then, do we not follow suit in the area of religion? Why 
continue to call a religion the same name when the tenets of that religion no longer fit the 
original one? Or, if religion does preach the same things that it always has, but its followers 
practice nearly none of its teachings, why do they continue to call themselves by the name 
given to followers of that religion? 

If you do not believe in what your religion teaches, why continue to support a belief which is 
contradictory with your feelings. You would never vote for a person or issue you did not 
believe in, so why cast your ecclesiastical vote for a religion which is not consistent with your 
convictions? You have no right to complain about a political situation you have voted for or 
supported in any way - which includes sitting back and complacently agreeing with neighbors 
who approve the situation, just because you are too lazy or cowardly to speak your mind. So it 
is with religious balloting. Even if you cannot be aggressively honest about your opinions 
because of unfavorable consequences from employers, community leaders, etc., you can, at 
least, be honest with yourself. In the privacy of your own home and with close friends you 
must support religion which has your best interests at heart. 

"Satanism is based on a very sound philosophy," say the emancipated. "But why call it 
Satanism? Why not call it something like 'Humanism' or a name that would have the 
connotation of a witchcraft group, something a little more esoteric - something less blatant." 
There is more than one reason for this. Humanism is not a religion. It is simply a way of life 
with no ceremony or dogma. Satanism has both ceremony and dogma. Dogma, as will be 
explained, is necessary. 

Satanism differs greatly from all other so-called white- light, "white" witchcraft or magical 
groups in the world today. These self-righteous and supercilious religions protest that their 
members use the powers of magic only for altruistic purposes. Satanists look with disdain 
upon "white" witchcraft groups because they feel that altruism is sinning on the lay- away 
plan. It is unnatural not to have desire to gain things for yourself. Satanism represents a form 
of controlled selfishness. This does not mean that you never do anything for anyone else. If 
you do something to make someone for whom you care happy, his happiness will give you a 
sense of gratification. 

Satanism advocates practicing a modified form of the Golden Rule. Our interpretation of this 
rule is: "Do unto others as they do unto you"; because if you "Do unto others as you would 
have them do unto you," and they, in turn, treat you badly, it goes against human nature to 
continue to treat them with consideration. You should do unto others as you would have them 



do unto you, but if your courtesy is not returned, they should be treated with the wrath they 
deserve. 

White witchcraft groups say that if you curse a person, it will return to you three- fold, come 
home to roost, or in some way boomerang back to the sender. This is yet another indication of 
the guilt- ridden philosophy which is held by these neo- Pagan, pseudo- Christian groups. White 
witches want to delve into witchcraft, but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma attached 
to it. Therefore, they call themselves white magicians, and base seventy- five per cent of their 
philosophy on the trite and hackneyed tenets of Christianity. Anyone who pretends to be 
interested in magic or the occult for reasons other that gaining personal power is the worst 
kind of hypocrite. The Satanist respects Christianity for, at least, being consistent in its guilt- 
ridden philosophy, but can only feel contempt for the people who attempt to appear 
emancipated from guilt by joining a witchcraft group, and then practice the same basic 
philosophy as Christianity. 

White magic is supposedly utilized only for good or unselfish purposes, and black magic, we 
are told, is used only for selfish or "evil" reasons. Satanism draws no such dividing line. 
Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. The Satanist, being the magician, should have the 
ability to decide what is just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals. 

During white magical ceremonies, the practitioners stand within a pentagram to protect 
themselves from the "evil" forces which they call upon for help. To the Satanist, it seems a bit 
two-faced to call on these forces for help, while at the same time protecting yourself from the 
very powers you have asked for assistance. The Satanist realizes that only by putting himself 
in league with these forces can be fully and unhypocritically utilize the Powers of Darkness to 
his best advantage. 

In a Satanic magical ceremony, the participants do not: join hands and dance "ring around the 
rosy" in a circle; bum candles of various colors for various wishes; call out the names of 
"Father, Son and Holy Ghost" while supposedly practicing Black Arts; pick a "Saint" for their 
personal guide in obtaining help for their problems; dunk themselves in smelly oils and hope 
the money comes in; meditate so they can arrive at a "great spiritual awakening"; recite long 
incantations with the name of Jesus thrown in for good measure, between every few words, 
etc., etc., etc., ad nauseam! 

because - This is not the way to practice Satanic magic. If you cannot divorce yourself from 
hypocritical self-deceit, you will never be successful as a magician, much less a Satanist. 

The Satanic religion has not merely lifted the coin - it has flipped it completely over. 
Therefore, why should it support the very principles to which it is completely opposed by 
calling itself anything other than a name which is totally in keeping with the reversed 
doctrines which make up the Satanic philosophy? Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a 
religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal - all of which are ruled by Satan, the 
personification of the Left Hand Path. 

Inevitably, the next question asked is: "Granted, you can't call it humanism because 
humanism is not a religion; but why even have a religion in the first place if all you do is what 
comes naturally, anyway? Why not just do it?" 

Modern man has come a long way; he has become disenchanted with the nonsensical dogmas 
of past religions. We are living in an enlightened age. Psychiatry has made great strides in 



enlightening man about his true personality. We are living in an era of intellectual awareness 
unlike any the world has ever seen. 

This is all very well and good, but - there is one flaw in this new state of awareness. It is one 
thing to accept something intellectually, but to accept the same thing emotionally is an 
entirely different matter. The one need that psychiatry cannot fill is man's inherent need for 
emotionalizing through dogma. Man needs ceremony and ritual, fantasy and enchantment. 
Psychiatry, despite all the good it has done, has robbed man of wonder and fantasy which 
religion, in the past, has provided. 

Satanism, realizing the current needs of man, fills the large grey void between religion and 
psychiatry. The Satanic philosophy combines the fundamentals of psychology and good, 
honest emotionalizing, or dogma. It provides man with his much needed fantasy. There is 
nothing wrong with dogma, providing it is not based on ideas and actions which go 
completely against human nature. 

The quickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight line. If all the guilts that 
have been built up can be turned into advantages, it ehrninates the need for intellectual 
purging of the psyche in an attempt to cleanse it from these repressions. Satanism is the only 
religion known to man that accepts man as he is, and promotes the rationale of turning a bad 
thing into a good thing rather than bending over backwards to eliminate the bad thing. 

Therefore, after intellectually evaluating your problems through common sense and drawing 
on what psychiatry has taught us, if you still cannot emotionally release yourself from 
unwarranted guilt, and put your theories into action, then you should learn to make your guilt 
work for you. You should act upon your natural instincts, and then, if you cannot perform 
without feeling guilty, revel in your guilt. This may sound like a contradiction in terms, but if 
you will think about it, guilt can often add a fillip to the senses. Adults would do well to take 
a lesson from children. Children often take great delight in doing something they know they 
are not supposed to. 

Yes, times have changed, but man hasn't. The basics of Satanism have always existed. The 
only thing that is new is the formal organization of a religion based on the universal traits of 
man. For centuries, magnificent structures of stone, concrete, mortar, and steel have been 
devoted to man's abstinence. It is high time that human beings stopped fighting themselves, 
and devoted their time to building temples designed for man's indulgences. 

Even though times have changed, and always will, man remains basically the same. For two 
thousand years man has done penance for something he never should have had to feel guilty 
about in the first place. We are tired of denying ourselves the pleasures of life which we 
deserve. Today, as always, man needs to enjoy himself here and now, instead of waiting for 
his rewards in heaven. So, why not have a religion based on indulgence? Certainly, it is 
consistent with the nature of the beast. We are no longer supplicating weaklings trembling 
before an unmerciful "God" who cares not whether we live or die. We are self-respecting, 
prideful people - we are Satanists! 



HELL, THE DEVIL, 

AND HOW TO 
SELL YOUR SOUL 




S atan has certainly been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in 

business all these years. The false doctrine of Hell and the Devil has allowed the 
Protestant and Catholic Churches to flourish far too long. Without a devil to point their 
fingers at, rehgionists of the right hand path would have nothing with which to threaten 
their followers. "Satan leads you to temptation"; "Satan is the prince of evil"; "Satan is 
vicious, cruel, brutal," they warn. "If you give in to the temptations of the devil, you 
will surely suffer eternal damnation and roast in Hell." 

The semantic meaning of Satan is the "adversary" or "opposition" or the "accuser". The very 
word "devil" comes from the Indian devi which means "god". Satan represents opposition to 
all religions which serve to frustrate and condemn man for his natural instincts. He has been 
given an evil role simply because he represents the carnal, earthly, and mundane aspects of 
life. 

Satan, the chief devil of the Western World, was originally an angel whose duty was to report 
human delinquencies to God. It was not until the Fourteenth Century that he began to be 
depicted as an evil deity who was part man and part animal, with goat- like horns and hooves. 
Before Christianity gave him the names of Satan, Lucifer, etc., the carnal side of man's nature 
was governed by the god which was then called Dionysus, or Pan, depicted as a satyr or faun, 
by the Greeks. Pan was originally the "good guy", and symbolized fertility and fecundity. 

Whenever a nation comes under a new form of government, the heroes of the past become 
villains of the present. So it is with religion. The earliest Christians believed that the Pagan 
deities were devils, and to employ them was to use "black magic". Miraculous heavenly 
events they termed "white magic"; this was the sole distinction between the two. The old gods 
did not die, they fell into Hell and became devils. The bogey, goblin, or bugaboo used to 
frighten children is derived from the Slavonic "Bog" which means "god", as does Bhaga in 
Hindu. 

Many pleasures revered before the advent of Christianity were condemned by the new 
religion. It required little changeover to transform the horns and cloven hooves of Pan into a 
most convincing devil! Pan's attributes could be neatiy changed into charged- with- punishment 
sins, and so the metamorphosis was complete. 

The association of the goat with the Devil is found in the Christian Bible, where the holiest 
day of the year, the Day of Atonement, was celebrated by casting lots for two goats "without 
blemish", one to be offered to the Lord, and one to Azazel. The goat carrying the sins of the 
people was driven into the desert and became a "scapegoat". This is the origin of the goat 
which is still used in lodge ceremonies today as it was also used in Egypt, where once a year 
it was sacrificed to a God. 

The devils of mankind are many, and their origins diversified. The performance of Satanic 
ritual does not embrace the calling forth of demons; this practice is followed only by those 
who are in fear of the very forces they conjure. 




Supposedly, demons are malevolent spirits with attributes conductive to the deterioration of 
the people or events that they touch upon. The Greek word demon meant a guardian spirit or 
source of inspiration, and to be sure, later theologians invented legion upon legion of these 
harbingers of inspiration - all wicked. 

An indication of the cowardice of "magicians" of the right-hand path is the practice of calling 
upon a particular demon (who would supposedly be a minion of the devil) to do his bidding. 
The assumption is that the demon, being only a flunky of the devil, is easier to control. Occult 
lore states that only the most formidably "protected" or insanely foolhardy sorcerer would try 
to call forth the Devil himself. 

The Satanist does not furtively call upon these "lesser" devils, but brazenly invokes those who 
people that infernal army of long-standing outrage - the Devils themselves! 

Theologians have catalogued some of the names of devils in their lists of demons, as might be 
expected, but the roster which follows contains the names and origins of the Gods and

The devils of past religions have always, at least in part, had animal characteristics, evidence 
of man's constant need to deny that he too is an animal, for to do so would serve a mighty 
blow to his impoverished ego. 

The pig was despised by the Jews and the Egyptians. It symbolized the gods Frey, Osiris, 
Adonis, Persephone, Attis, and Demeter, and was sacrificed to Osiris and the Moon. But, in 
time, it became degraded into a devil. The Phoenicians worshipped a fly god, Baal, from which 
comes the devil, Beelzebub. Both Baal and Beelzebub are identical to the dung beetle or 
scarabaeus of the Egyptians which appeared to resurrect itself, much as the mythical bird, the 
phoenix, rose from its own ashes. The ancient Jews believed, through their contact with the 
Persians, that the two great forces in the world were Ahura- Mazda, the god of fire, tight, life, 
and goodness; and Ahriman, the serpent, the god of darkness, destruction, death, and evil. 
These, and countless other examples, not only depict man's devils as animals, but also show 
his need to sacrifice the original animal gods and demote them to his devils. 

At the time of the Reformation, in the Sixteenth Century, the alchemist, Dr. Johann Faustus, 
discovered a method of summoning a demon - Mephistopheles - from Hell and making a pact 
with him. He signed a contract in blood to turn his soul over to Mephistopheles in return for 
the feeling of youth, and at once became young. When the time came for Faustus to die, he 
retired to his room and was blown to bits as though his laboratory had exploded. This story is 
a protest of the times (the Sixteenth Century) against science, chemistry, and magic. 

To the Satanist, it is unnecessary to sell your soul to the Devil or make a pact with Satan. This 
threat was devised by Christianity to terrorize people so they would not stray from the fold. 
With scolding fingers and trembling voices, they taught their followers that if they gave in to 
the temptations of Satan, and lived their lives according to their natural predilections, they 
would have to pay for their sinful pleasures by giving their souls to Satan and suffering in 
Hell for all eternity. People were led to believe that a pure soul was a passport to everlasting 
life. 

Pious prophets have taught man to fear Satan. But what of terms like "God fearing"? If God is 
so merciful, why do people have to fear him? Are we to believe there is nowhere we can turn 
to escape fear? If you have to fear God, why not be "Satan fearing" and at least have the fun 
that being God fearing denies you? Without such a wholesale fear religionists would have had 
nothing with which to wield power over their followers. 

The Teutonic Goddess of the Dead and daughter of Loki was named Hel, a Pagan god of 
torture and punishment. Another "L" was added when the books of the Old Testament were 
formulated. The prophets who wrote the Bible did not know the word "Hell"; they used the 
Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades, which meant the grave; also the Greek Tartaros, which 
was the abode of fallen angels, the underworld (inside the earth), and Gehenna, which was a 
valley near Jerusalem where Moloch reigned and garbage was dumped and burned. It is from 
this that the Christian Church has evolved the idea of "fire and brimstone" in Hell. 

The Protestant Hell and the Catholic Hell are places of eternal punishment; however, the 
Catholics also believe there is a "Purgatory" where all souls go for a time, and a "Limbo" 
where unbaptized souls go. The Buddhist Hell is divided into eight sections, the first seven of 



which can be expiated. The ecclesiastical description of Hell is that of a horrible place of fire 
and torment; in Dante's Inferno, and in northern climes, it was thought to be an icy cold 
region, a giant refrigerator. 

(Even with all their threats of eternal damnation and soul roasting, Christian missionaries 
have run across some who were not so quick to swallow their drivel. Pleasure and pain, like 
beauty, are in the eye of the beholder. So, when missionaries ventured into Alaska and warned 
the Eskimos of the horrors of Hell and the blazing lake of fire awaiting transgressors, they 
eagerly asked: "How do we get there?" !) 

Most Satanists do not accept Satan as an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed 
tail, and horns. He merely represents a force in nature - the powers of darkness which have 
been named just that because no religion has taken these forces out of the darkness. Nor has 
science been able to apply technical terminology to this force. It is an untapped reservoir that 
few can make use of because they lack the ability use a tool without having to first break 
down and label all the parts which make it run. It is this incessant need to analyze which 
prohibits most people from taking advantage of this many faceted key to the unknown - which 
the Satanist chooses to call "Satan". 

Satan, as a god, demi-god, personal saviour, or whatever you wish to call him, was invented 
by the formulators of every religion on the face of the earth for only one purpose - to preside 
over man's so-called wicked activities and situations here on earth. Consequently, anything 
resulting in physical or mental gratification was defined as "evil" - thus assuring a lifetime of 
unwarranted guilt for everyone! 

So, if "evil" they have named us, evil we are - and so what! The Satanic Age is upon us! Why 
not take advantage of it and LIVE! 



LOVE AND HATE 




Satanism represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on 
ingrates! 

You cannot love everyone; it is ridiculous to think you can. If you love everyone and 
everything you lose your natural powers of selection and wind up being a pretty poor 
judge of character and quality. If anything is used too freely it loses its true meaning. 
Therefore, the Satanist believes you should love strongly and completely those who 
deserve your love, but never turn the other cheek to your enemy! 

Love is one of the most intense emotions felt by man; another is hate. Forcing yourself to feel 
indiscriminate love is very unnatural. If you try to love everyone you only lessen your 
feelings for those who deserve your love. Repressed hatred can lead to many physical and 
emotional ailments. By learning to release your hatred towards those who deserve it, you 
cleanse yourself of these malignant emotions and need not take your pent-up hatred out on 
your loved ones. 

There has never been a great "love" movement in the history of the world that hasn't wound 
up killing countless numbers of people, we must assume, to prove how much they loved 
them! Every hypocrite who ever walked the earth has had pockets bulging with love! 

Every pharisaical rehgionist claims to love his enemies, even though when wronged he 
consoles himself by tMnking "God will punish them". Instead of admitting to themselves that 
they are capable of hating their foes and treating them in the manner they deserve, they say: 
"There, but for the grace of God, go I," and "pray" for them. Why should we humiliate and 
lower ourselves by drawing such inaccurate comparisons? 

Satanism has been thought of as being synonymous with cruelty and brutality. This is so only 
because people are afraid to face the truth - and the truth is that human beings are not all 
benign or all loving. Just because the Satanist admits he is capable of both love and hate, he is 
considered hateful. On the contrary, because he is able to give vent to his hatred through 
ritualized expression, he is far more capable of love - the deepest kind of love. By honestiy 
recognizing and admitting to both the hate and the love he feels, there is no confusing one 
emotion with the other. Without being able to experience one of these emotions, you cannot 
fully experience the other. 



SATANIC SEX 




TVIuch controversy has arisen over the Satanic views on "free love". It is often 

assumed that sexual activity is the most important factor of the Satanic religion, and 
that willingness to participate in sex- orgies is a prerequisite for becoming a Satanist. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth! In fact, opportunists who have no deeper 
interest in Satanism than merely the sexual aspects are emphatically discouraged. 

Satanism does advocate sexual freedom, but only in the true sense of the word. Free 
love, in the Satanic concept, means exactly that - freedom to either be faithful to one 
person or to indulge your sexual desires with as many others as you feel is necessary to satisfy 
your particular needs. 

Satanism does not encourage orgiastic activity or extramarital affairs for those to whom they 
do not come naturally. For many, it would be very unnatural and detrimental to be unfaithful 
to their chosen mates. To others, it would be frustrating to be bound sexually to just one 
person. Each person must decide for himself what form of sexual activity best suits his 
individual needs. Self- deceitfully forcing yourself to be adulterous or to have sex partners 
when not married just for the sake of proving others (or worse yet, to yourself) that you are 
emancipated from sexual guilt is just as wrong, by Satanic standards, as leaving any sexual 
need unfulfilled because of ingrained feelings of guilt. 

Many of those who are constantly preoccupied with demonstrating their emancipation from 
sexual guilt are, in reality, held in even greater sexual bondage than those who simply accept 
sexual activity as a natural part of life and don't make a big to-do over their sexual freedom. 
For example, it is an established fact that the nymphomaniac (every man's dream girl and 
heroine of all lurid novels) is not sexually free, but is actually frigid and roves from man to 
man because she is too inhibited to ever find complete sexual release. 

Another misconception is the idea that ability to engage in group sexual activity is the 
indicative of sexual freedom. All contemporary free- sex groups have one thing in common - 
discouragement of fetishistic or deviant activity. 

Actually, the most forced examples of non- fetishistic sexual activity thinly disguised as 
"freedom" have a common format. Each of the participants in an orgy removes all clothing, 
following the example set forth by one, and mechanically fornicate - also following the 
leader's example. None of the performers consider that their "emancipated" form of sex might 
be regarded as regimented and infantile by non- members who fail to equate uniformity with 
freedom. 

The Satanist realizes that if he is to be a sexual connoisseur (and truly free from all sexual 
guilt) he cannot be stifled by the so-called sexual revolutionists any more than he can by the 
prudery of his guilt- ridden society. These free- sex clubs miss the whole point of sexual 
freedom. Unless sexual activity can be expressed on an individual basis (which includes 
personal fetishes), there is absolutely no purpose in belonging to a sexual freedom 
organization. 

Satanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your individual desires 
- be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual, if you choose. Satanism also 




sanctions any fetish or deviation which will enhance your sex- life, so long as it involves no 
one who does not wish to be involved. 

The prevalence of deviant and/or fetishistic behavior in our society would stagger the 
imagination of the sexually naive. There are more sexual variants than the unenlightened 
individual can perceive: transvestism, sadism, masochism, urolagnia, exhibitionism - to name 
only a few of the more predominant. Everyone has some form of fetish, but because they are 
unaware of the preponderance of fetishistic activity in our society, they feel they are depraved 
if they submit to their "unnatural" yearnings. 

Even the asexual has a deviation - his asexuality. It is far more abnormal to have a lack of 
sexual desire (unless illness or old-age, or another valid reason has caused the wane) than it is 
to be sexually promiscuous. However, if a Satanist chooses sexual sublimination above overt 
sexual expression, that is entirely his own affair. In many cases of sexual sublimination (or 
asexuality), any attempt to emancipate himself sexually would prove devastating to the 
asexual. 

Asexuals are invariably sexually sublimated by their jobs or hobbies. All the energy and 
driving interest which would normally be devoted to sexual activity is channeled into other 
pastimes or into their chosen occupations. If a person favors other interests over sexual 
activity, it is his right, and no one is justified in condemning him for it. However, the person 
should at least recognize the fact that this is a sexual sublimation. 

Because of lack of opportunity for expression, many secret sexual desires never progress 
beyond the fantasy stage. Lack of release often leads to compulsion and, therefore, a great 
number of people devise undetectable methods of giving vent to their urges. Just because 
most fetishistic activity is not outwardly apparent, the sexually unsophisticated should not 
delude himself into tliinking it does not exist. To cite examples of the ingenious techniques 
used: The male transvestite will indulge in his fetish by wearing feminine undergarments 
while going about his daily activities; or the masochistic woman might wear a rubber girdle 
several sizes too small, so she may derive sexual pleasure from her fetishistic discomfort 
throughout the day, with no one the wiser. These illustrations are far tamer and more 
prevalent examples than others which could have been given. 

Satanism encourages any form of sexual expression you may desire, so long as it hurts no one 
else. This statement must be qualified, to avoid misinterpretation. By not hurting another, this 
does not include the unintentional hurt felt by those who might not agree with your views on 
sex, because of their anxieties regarding sexual morality. Naturally, you should avoid 
offending others who mean a great deal to you, such as prudish friends and relatives. 
However, if you earnestly endeavor to escape hurting them, and despite your efforts they 
accidentally find out, you cannot be held responsible, and therefore should feel no guilt as a 
result of either your sexual convictions, or their being hurt because of those convictions. If 
you are in constant fear of offending the prudish by your attitude towards sex, then there is no 
sense in trying to emancipate yourself from sexual guilt. However, no purpose is served by 
flaunting your permissiveness. 

The other exception to the rule regards dealings with masochists. A masochist derives 
pleasure from being hurt; so denying the masochist his pleasure- through- pain hurts him just as 
much as actual physical pain hurts the non- masochist. The story of the truly cruel sadist 
illustrates this point: The masochist says to the sadist, "beat me." To which the merciless 
sadist replies, 'ko!" If a person wants to be hurt and enjoys suffering, then there is no reason 



not to indulge him in his wont. 



The term "sadist" in popular usage describes one who obtains pleasure from indiscriminate 
brutality. Actually, though, a true sadist is selective. He carefully chooses from the vast 
reserve of appropriate victims, and takes great delight in giving those who thrive on misery 
the fulfillment of their desires. The "well-adjusted" sadist is epicurean in selecting those on 
whom his energies will be well- spent! If a person is healthy enough to admit he is a masochist 
and enjoys being enslaved and whipped, the real sadist is glad to oblige! 

Aside from the foregoing exceptions, the Satanist would not intentionally hurt others by 
violating their sexual rights. If you attempt to impose your sexual desires upon others who do 
not welcome your advances, you are Mringing upon their sexual freedom. Therefore, 
Satanism does not advocate rape, child molesting, sexual defilement of animals, or any other 
form of sexual activity which entails the participation of those who are unwilling or whose 
innocence or naivete would allow them to be intimidated or misguided into doing something 
against their wishes. 

If all parties involved are mature adults who willingly take full responsibility for their actions 
and voluntarily engage in a given form of sexual expression - even if it is generally 
considered taboo - then there is no reason for them to repress their sexual inclinations. 

If you are aware of all the implications, advantages, and disadvantages, and are certain your 
actions will hurt no one who does not wish or deserve to be hurt, you have no cause to 
suppress your sexual preferences. 

Just as no two people are exactly the same in their choice of diet or have the same capacity for 
the consumption of food, sexual tastes and appetites vary from person to person. No person or 
society has the right to set limitations on the sexual standards or the frequency of sexual 
activity of another. Proper sexual conduct can only be judged within the context of each 
individual situation. Therefore, what one person considers sexually correct and moral may be 
frustrating to another. The reverse is also true; one person may have great sexual prowess, but 
it is unjust for him to belittle another whose sexual capacity may not equal his own, and 
inconsiderate for him to impose himself upon the other person, i.e., the man who has a 
voracious sexual appetite, but whose wife's sexual needs do not match his own. It is unfair for 
him to expect her to enthusiastically respond to his overtures; but she must display the same 
degree of thoughtfulness. In the instances when she does not feel great passion, she should 
either passively, but pleasantly, accept him sexually, or raise no complaint if he chooses to 
find his needed release elsewhere - including auto- erotic practices. 

The ideal relationship is one in which the people are deeply in love with one another and are 
sexually compatible. However, perfect relationships are relatively uncommon. It is important 
to point out here that spiritual love and sexual love can, but do not necessarily, go hand in 
hand. If there is a certain amount of sexual compatibility, often it is limited; and some, but not 
all, of the sexual desires will be fulfilled. 

There is no greater sexual pleasure than that derived from association with someone you 
deeply love, if you are sexually well- suited. If you are not suited to one another sexually, 
though, it must be stressed that lack of sexual compatibility does not indicate lack of spiritual 
love. One can, and often does, exist without the other. As a matter of fact, often one member 
of a couple will resort to outside sexual activity because he deeply loves his mate, and wishes 
to avoid hurting or imposing upon his loved one. Deep spiritual love is enriched by sexual 



love, and it is certainly a necessary ingredient for any satisfactory relationship; but because of 
differing sexual predilections, outside sexual activity or masturbation sometimes provides a 
needed supplement. 

Masturbation, considered a sexual taboo by many people, creates a guilt problem not easily 
dealt with. Much emphasis must be placed on this subject, as it constitutes an extremely 
important ingredient of many a successful magical working. 

Ever since the Judaeo- Christian Bible described the sin of Onan (Gen. 38:7-10), man has 
considered the seriousness and consequences of the "solitary vice". Even though modem 
sexologists have explained the sin of Onan as simply coitus interruptus, the damage has been 
done through centuries of theological misinterpretation. 

Aside from actual sex crimes, masturbation is one of the most frowned upon sexual acts. 
During the last century, innumerable texts were written describing the horrific consequences 
of masturbation. Practically all physical or mental illnesses were attributed to the evils of 
masturbation. Pallor of the complexion, shortness of breath, furtive expression, sunken chest, 
nervousness, pimples and loss of appetite are only a few of the many characteristics 
supposedly resulting from masturbation; total physical and mental collapse was assured if one 
did not heed the warnings in those handbooks for young men. 

The lurid descriptions in such texts would be almost humorous, were it not for the unhappy 
fact that even though contemporary sexologists, doctors, writers, etc. have done much to 
remove the stigma of masturbation, the deep-seated guilts induced by the nonsense in those 
sexual primers have been only partially erased. A large percentage of people, especially those 
over forty, cannot emotionally accept the fact that masturbation is natural and healthy, even if 
they now accept it intellectually; and they, in turn, relate their repugnance, often 
subconsciously, to their children. 

It was thought that one would go insane if, despite numerous admonitions, his auto- erotic 
practices persisted. This preposterous myth grew from reports of wide- spread masturbation by 
the inmates of mental institutions. It was assumed that since almost all incurably insane 
people masturbated, it was their masturbation that had driven them mad. No one ever stopped 
to consider the lack of sexual partners of the opposite sex and the freedom from inhibition, 
which is a characteristic of extreme insanity, were the real reasons for the masturbatory 
practices of the insane. 

Many people would rather have their mates seek outside sexual activity than perform auto- 
erotic acts because of their own guilt feelings, the mate's repugnance towards having them 
engage in masturbation, or the fear of their mate's repugnance - although in a surprising 
number of cases, a vicarious thrill is obtained from the knowledge that the mate is having 
sexual experiences with outsiders - although this is seldom admitted. 

If stimulation is provided by envisioning one's mate sexually engaged with others, this should 
be brought out into the open where both parties may gain from such activities. However, if the 
prohibition of masturbation is only due to guilt feelings on the part of one or both parties, they 
should make every attempt to erase those guilts - or utilize them. Many relationships might be 
saved from destruction if the people involved did not feel guilt about performing the natural 
act of masturbation. 

Masturbation is regarded as evil because it produces pleasure derived from intentionally 



fondling a "forbidden" area of the body by one's own hand. The guilt feelings accompanying 
most sexual acts can be assuaged by the religiously- acceptable contention that your sensual 
delights are necessary to produce off- spring - even though you cautiously watch the calendar 
for the "safe" days. You cannot, however, placate yourself with this rationale while engaging 
in masturbatory practices. 

No matter what you've been told about the "immaculate conception" - even if blind faith 
allows you to swallow this absurdity - you know full well if you are to produce a child, there 
must be sexual contact with a person of the opposite sex! If you feel guilty for committing the 
"original sin," you certainly will feel even deeper guilt for performing a sex act only for self- 
gratification, with no intention of creating children. 

The Satanist fully realizes why religionists declare masturbation to be sinful. Like all other 
natural acts people will do it, no matter how severely reprimanded. Causing guilt is an 
important facet of their malicious scheme to obligate people to atone for "sins" by paying the 
mortgages on temples of abstinence! 

Even if a person is no longer struggling under the burden of religiously- induced guilt (or 
thinks he isn't), modem man still feels shame if he yields to his masturbatory desires. A man 
may feel robbed of his masculinity if he satisfies himself auto-erotically rather than engaging 
in the competitive game of woman chasing. A woman may satisfy herself sexually but yearns 
for the ego -gratification that comes from the sport of seduction. Neither the quasi Casanova 
nor bogus vamp feels adequate when "reduced" to masturbation for sexual gratification; both 
would prefer even an inadequate partner. Satanically speaking, though, it is far better to 
engage in a perfect fantasy than to cooperate in an unrewarding experience with another 
person. With masturbation, you are in complete control of the situation. 

To illustrate the undebatable fact that masturbation is an entirely normal and healthy practice: 
it is performed by all members of the animal kingdom. Human children will also follow their 
instinctive masturbatory desires, unless they have been scolded for it by their indignant parents, 
who were undoubtably berated for it by their parents, and so on down the retrocedent line. 

It is unfortunate, but true, that the sexual guilts of parents will immutably be passed on to their 
children. In order to save our children from the ill-fated sexual destiny of our parents, 
grandparents, and possibly ourselves, the perverted moral code of the past must be exposed 
for what it is: a pragmatically organized set of rules which, if rigidly obeyed, would destroy 
us! Unless we emancipate ourselves from the ridiculous sexual standards of our present 
society, including the so-called sexual revolution, the neuroses caused by those stifling 
regulations will persist. Adherence to the sensible and humanistic new morality of Satanism 
can - and will - evolve society in which our children can grow up healthy and without the 
devastating moral encumbrances of our existing sick society. 



NOT ALL VAMPIRES 
SUCK BLOOD! 




Satanism represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic 
vampires. 

Many people who walk the earth practice the fine art of making others feel responsible 
and even indebted to them, without cause. Satanism observes these leeches in their true 
light. Psychic vampires are individuals who drain others of their vital energy. This type 
of person can be found in all avenues of society. They fill no useful purpose in our 
lives, and are neither love objects nor true friends. Yet we feel responsible to the 
psychic vampire without knowing why. 

If you think you may be the victim of such a person, there are a few simple rules which will 
help you form a decision. Is there a person you often call or visit, even though you really don't 
want to, because you know you will feel guilty if you don't? Or, do you find yourself 
constantiy doing favors for one who doesn't come forward and ask, but hints? Often the 
psychic vampire will use reverse psychology, saying: "Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that" - and 
you, in turn, insist upon doing it. The psychic vampire never demands anything of you. That 
would be far too presumptuous. They simply let their wishes be known in subtie ways which 
will prevent them from being considered pests. They "wouldn't think of imposing" and are 
always content and willingly accept their lot, without the slightest complaint - outwardly! 

Their sins are not of commission, but of omission. It's what they don 't say, not what they do 
say, that makes you feel you must account to them. They are much too crafty to make overt 
demands upon you, because they know you would resent it, and would have a tangible and 
legitimate reason for denying them. 

A large percentage of these people have special "attributes" which make their dependence 
upon you more feasible and much more effective. Many psychic vampires are invalids (or 
pretend to be) or are "mentally or emotionally disturbed." Others might feign ignorance or 
incompetence so you will, out of pity - or more often, exasperation - do things for them. 

The traditional way to banish a demon or elemental is to recognize it for what it is, and 
exorcise it. Recognition of these modem- day demons and their methods is the only antidote 
for their devastating hold over you. 

Most people accept these passively vicious individuals at face value only because their 
insidious maneuvers have never been pointed out to them. They merely accept these "poor 
souls" as being less fortunate than themselves, and feel they must help them however they 
can. It is this misdirected sense of responsibility (or unfounded sense of guilt) which 
nourishes well the "altruisms" upon which these parasites feast! 

The psychic vampire is allowed to exist because he cleverly chooses conscientious, 
responsible people for his victims - people with great dedication to their "moral obligations." 

In some cases we are vampirized by groups of people, as well as individuals. Every fund 
raising organization, be it a charitable foundation, community council, religious or fraternal 
association, etc., carefully selects a person who is adept at making others feel guilty for its 




chairman or coordinator. It is the job of this chairman to intimidate us into opening first our 
hearts, and then our wallets, to the recipient of their "good will" - never mentioning that, in 
many cases, their time is not unselfishly donated, but that they are drawing a fat salary for 
their "noble deeds." They are masters at playing upon the sympathy and consideration of 
responsible people. How often we see little children who have been sent forth by these self- 
righteous Fagins to painlessly extract donations from the kindly. Who can resist the innocent 
charm of a child? 

There are, of course, people who are not happy unless they are giving, but many of us do not 
fit into this category. Unfortunately, we are often put upon to do things we do not genuinely 
feel should be required of us. A conscientious person finds it very difficult to decide between 
voluntary and imposed charity. He wants to do what is right and just, and finds it perplexing 
trying to decide exactly who he should help and what degree of aid should rightfully be 
expected of him. 

Each person must decide for himself what his obhgations are to his respective friends, family, 
and community. Before donating his time and money to those outside his immediate family 
and close circle of friends, he must decide what he can afford, without depriving those closest 
to him. When taking these things into consideration he must be certain to include himself 
among those who mean most to him. He must carefully evaluate the validity of the request 
and the personality or motives of the person asking it of him. 

It is extremely difficult for a person to learn to say "no" when all his life he has said "yes." 
But unless he wants to be constantly taken advantage of, he must learn to say "no" when 
circumstances justify doing so. If you allow them, psychic vampires will gradually infiltrate 
your everyday life until you have no privacy left - and your constant feeling of concern for 
them will deplete you of all ambition. 

A psychic vampire will always select a person who is relatively content and satisfied with his 
life - a person who is happily married, pleased with his job, and generally well-adjusted to the 
world around him - to feed upon. The very fact that the psychic vampire chooses to victimize 
a happy person shows that he is lacking all the things his victim has; he will do everything he 
can to stir up trouble and disharmony between his victim and those people he holds dear. 

Therefore, be wary of anyone who seems to have no real friends and no apparant interest in 
life (except you). He will usually tell you he is very selective in his choice of friends, or 
doesn't make friends easily because of the high standards he sets for his companions. (To 
acquire and keep friends, one must be willing to give of himself - something of which the 
psychic vampire is incapable.) But he will hasten to add that you fulfill every requirement and 
are truly an outstanding exception among men - you are one of the very few worthy of his 
friendship. 

Lest you confuse desperate love (which is a very selfish thing) with psychic vampirism, the 
vast difference between the two must be clarified. The only way to determine if you are being 
vampirized is to weigh what you give the person compared to what they give you in return. 

You may, at times, become annoyed with the obhgations put upon you by a loved one, a close 
friend, or even an employer. But before you label them psychic vampires, you must ask 
yourself, "What am I getting in return?" If your spouse or lover insists that you call them 
frequentiy, but you also require them to account to you for their time spent away from you, 
you must realize this is a give and take situation. Or, if a friend is in the habit of calling upon 



you for help at inopportune moments, but you similarly depend upon them to give your 
immediate needs priority, you must regard it as a fair exchange. If your employer asks you to 
do a little more than is normally expected of you in your particular position, but will overlook 
occasional tardiness or will give you time off when you need it, you certainly have no cause 
for complaint and need not feel he is taking advantage of you. 

You are, however, being vampirized if you are incessantly called upon or expected to do 
favors for someone who, when you need a favor, always happens to have other "pressing 
obligations." 

Many psychic vampires will give you material things for the express purpose of making you 
feel you owe them something in return, thereby binding you to them. The difference between 
your giving, and theirs, is that your return payment must come in a non- material form. They 
want you to feel obligated to them, and would be very disappointed and even resentful if you 
attempted to repay them with material objects. In essence, you have "sold your soul" to them, 
and they'll constantly remind you of your duty to them, by not reminding you. 

Being purely Satanic, the only way to deal with a psychic vampire is to "play dumb" and act 
as though they are genuinely altruistic and really expect nothing in return. Teach them a 
lesson by graciously taking what they give you, thanking them loudly enough for all to hear, 
and walking away! In this way you come out the victor. What can they say? And when you 
are inevitably expected to repay their "generosity," (this is the hard part!) you say "no" - but 
again, graciously! When they feel you falling from their clutches two things will happen. 
First, they will act "crushed," hoping your old feeling of duty and sympathy will return, and 
when (and if) it doesn't, they will show their true colors and will become angry and 
vindictive. 

Once you have moved them to this point, you can play the role of the injured party. After all, 
you've done nothing wrong - you just happened to have had "pressing obligations" when they 
needed you, and since nothing was expected in return for their gifts, there should be no hard 
feelings. 

Generally, the psychic vampire will realize his methods have been discovered and will not 
press the issue. He will not continue to waste his time with you, but will move on to his next 
unsuspecting victim. 

There are times, however, when the psychic vampire will not release his hold so easily, and 
will do everything possible to torment you. They have plenty of time for this because, when 
once rejected, they will neglect all else (what little else they have, that is) to devote their every 
waking moment to planning the revenge to which they feel they are entitled. For this reason, it 
is best to avoid a relationship with this kind of person in the first place. Their "adulation" and 
dependence upon you may, at first, be very flattering, and their material gifts very attractive, 
but you will eventually find yourself paying for them many times over. 

Don't waste your time with people who will ultimately destroy you, but concentrate instead on 
those who will appreciate your responsibility to them, and, likewise, feel responsible to you. 

And if you are a psychic vampire - take heed! Beware of the Satanist - he is ready and willing 
to gleefully drive the proverbial stake through your heart! 



INDULGENCE . . . NOT COMPULSION 



THE HIGHEST PLATEAU OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 
IS THE AWARENESS OF THE FLESh! 



fljf Satanism encourages its followers to indulge in their natural desires. Only by doing so 

^Bjt^can you be a completely satisfied person with no frustrations which can be harmful to 
Jm yourself and others around you. Therefore, the most simplified description of the 
£ Satanic belief is: 

\ INDULGENCE INSTEAD OF ABSTINENCE 

People often mistake compulsion for indulgence, but there is a world of difference 
between the two. A compulsion is never created by indulging, but by not being able to 
indulge. By making something taboo, it only serves to intensify the desire. Everyone likes to 
do the things they have been told not to. "Forbidden fruits are sweetest." 

Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary defines indulgence thusly: "To give oneself up to; not to 
restrain or oppose; to give free course to; to gratify by compliance; to yield to." The 
dictionary definition of compulsion is: "The act of compelling or driving by a force, physical 
or moral; constraint of the will; (compulsory, obligatory)." In other words, indulgence implies 
choice, whereas compulsion indicates the lack of choice. 

When a person has no proper release for his desires they rapidly build up and become 
compulsions. If everyone had a particular time and place for the purpose of periodically 
indulging in their personal desires, without fear of embarrassment or reproach, they would be 
sufficiently released to lead unfrustrated lives in the everyday world. They would be free to 
plunge headlong into whatever undertaking they might choose instead of going about their 
duties half-heartedly, their creative urges frustrated by denying their natural desires. This 
would apply in the majority of cases, but there will always be those who work better under 
pressure. 

Generally, those who need to endure a certain amount of hardship to produce to their full 
capabilities are in basically artistic vocations. (More will be said later about fulfillment 
through self-denial.) This does not mean to imply that all artists fit into this category. On the 
contrary, many artists are unable to produce unless their basic animal needs have been 
satisfied. 

For the most part, it is not the artist or individualist, but the average middle-class working 
man or woman who is lacking the proper release for their desires. It is ironic that the 
responsible, respectable person - the one who pays society's bills - should be the one given the 
least in return. It is he who must be ever conscious of his "moral obhgations", and who is 
condemned for normally indulging in his natural desires. 

The Satanic religion considers this a gross injustice. He who upholds his responsibilities 
should be most entitied to the pleasures of his choice, without censure from the society he 
serves. 

Finally a religion (Satanism) has been formed which commends and rewards those who 
support the society in which they live, instead of denouncing them for their human needs. 



From every set of principles (be it religious, political, or philosophical), some good can be 
extracted. Amidst the madness of the Hitlerian concept, one point stands out as a shining 
example of this - "strength through joy!". Hitier was no fool when he offered the German 
people happiness, on a personal level, to insure their loyalty to him, and peak efficiency from 
them. 

It has been clearly established that the majority of all illnesses are of a psychosomatic nature, 
and that psychosomatic illnesses are a direct result of frustration. It has been said that "the 
good die young". The good, by Christian standards, do die young. It is the frustration of our 
natural instincts which leads to the deterioration of our minds and bodies. 

It has become very fashionable to concentrate on the betterment of the mind and spirit, and to 
consider giving pleasure to one's body (the very shell without which the mind and spirit could 
not exist) to be coarse, crude, unrefined, as of late, most people who deem themselves emancipated 
have left normalcy only to "transcend" into idiocy! By way of bending their behinds around to 
meet their navels, subsisting on wild and exotic diets like brown rice and tea, they feel they 
will arrive at a great state of spiritual development. 

"Hogwash!" says the Satanist. He would rather eat a good hearty meal, exercise his 
imagination, and transcend by means of physical and emotional fulfillment. It seems, to the 
Satanist, that after being harnessed with unreasonable religious demands for so many 
centuries, one would welcome the chance to be human for once! 

If anyone thinks that by denying his natural desires he can avoid mediocrity, he should 
examine the Eastern mystical beliefs which have been in great intellectual favor in recent 
years. Christianity is "old-hat", so those who wish to escape its fetters have turned to so-called 
enlightened rehgions, such as Buddhism. Although Christianity is certainly deserving of the 
criticism it has received, perhaps it has been taking more than its share of the blame. The 
followers of the mystical beliefs are every bit as guilty of the little humanisms as the 
"misguided" Christians. Both rehgions are based on trite philosophies, but the mystical 
religionists profess to be enlightened and emancipated from the guilt-ridden dogma which is 
typified by Christianity. However, the Eastern mystic is even more preoccupied than the 
Christian with avoiding animahstic actions that remind him he is not a "saint", but merely a 
man - only another form of animal, sometimes better, more often worse, than those who walk 
on all fours; and who, because of his "divine spiritual and intellectual development", has 
become the most vicious animal of all! 

The Satanist asks, "What is wrong with being human, and having human limitations as well as 
assets?" By denying his desires the mystic has come no closer to overcoming compulsion than 
his kindred soul, the Christian. The Eastern mystical beliefs have taught people to 
contemplate their navels, stand on their heads, stare at blank walls, avoid the use of labels in 
life, and discipline themselves against any desire for materialistic pleasure. Nevertheless, I am 
sure you have seen just as many so-called disciplined yogis with the inability to control a 
smoking habit as anyone else; or just as many supposedly emancipated Buddhists become just 
as excited as a "less aware" person when they are confronted with a member of the opposite - 
or in some cases, the same - sex. Yet when asked to explain the reason for their hypocrisy, 
these people retreat into the ambiguousness which characterizes their faith - no one can pin 
them down if there are no straight answers that can be given! 

The simple fact of the matter is that the very thing which has led this type of person to a faith 
which preaches abstinence, is indulgence. Their compulsive masochism is the reason for 



choosing a religion which not only advocates self-denial, but praises them for it; and gives 
them a sacrosanct avenue of expression for their masochistic needs. The more abuse they can 
stand, the holier they become. 

Masochism, to most people, represents a rejection of indulgence. Satanism points out many 
meanings behind the meanings, and considers masochism to be an indulgence if any attempt 
to sway or change the person from his masochistic traits is met with resentment and/or failure. 
The Satanist does not condemn these people for giving vent to their masochistic desires, but 
he does feel the utmost contempt towards those who cannot be honest enough (at least with 
themselves) to face and accept their masochism as a natural part of their personality make-up. 

Having to use religion as an excuse for their masochism is bad enough, but these people 
actually have the effrontery to feel superior to those who are not bound- up in self- deceitful 
expression of their fetishes! These people would be the first to condemn a man who found his 
weekly release with a person who would beat him soundly, thereby releasing himself from the 
very thing which could, if unreleased, make him - as they are - a compulsive church-goer or 
religious fanatic. By finding adequate release for his masochistic desires, he no longer needs 
to debase and deny himself in his every waking moment, as do these compulsive masochists. 

Satanists are encouraged to indulge in the seven deadly sins, as they need hurt no one; they 
were only invented by the Christian Church to insure guilt on the part of its followers. The 
Christian Church knows that it is impossible for anyone to avoid committing these sins, as 
they are all things which we, being human, most naturally do. After inevitably committing 
these sins financial offerings to the church in order to "pay off God are employed as a sop to 
the parishioner's conscience! 

Satan has never needed a book of rules, because vital natural forces have kept man "sinful" 
and intent on preserving himself and his feelings. Nevertheless, demoralizing attempts have 
been made on his body and being for his "soul's" sake, which only illustrate how 
misconceived and misused the labels of "indulgence" versus "compulsion" have become. 

Sexual activity certainly is condoned and encouraged by Satanism, but obviously the fact that 
it is the only religion which honestly takes this stand, is the reason it has been traditionally 
given so much literary space. 

Naturally, if most people belong to the religions which repress them sexually, anything 
written on this provocative subject is going to make for titillating reading. 

If all attempts to sell something (be it a product or an idea) have failed - sex will always sell 
it. The reason for this is that even though people now consciously accept sex as a normal and 
necessary function, their subconscious is still bound by the taboo which religion has placed 
upon it. So, again, what is denied is more intensely desired. It is this bugaboo regarding sex 
which causes the literature devoted to the Satanic views on the subject to overshadow all else 
written about Satanism. 

The true Satanist is not mastered by sex any more than he is mastered by any of his other 
desires. As with all other pleasurable things, the Satanist is master of, rather than mastered by 
sex. He is not the perverted fiend who is just waiting for the opportunity to deflower every 
young virgin, nor is he the skulking degenerate who furtively hangs around in the "dirty" 
bookstores, slavering over the "nasty" pictures. If pornography fills his needs for the moment, 
he unashamedly buys some "choice items" and guiltlessly peruses them at his leisure. 



"We have to accept the fact that man has become disgruntled at being constantly repressed, 
but we must do everything we can to at least temper the sinful desires of man, lest they run 
rampant in this new age," say the rehgionists of the right-hand path to the questioning 
Satanist. "Why continue to think of these desires as shameful and something to be repressed, 
if you now admit they are natural?" returns the Satanist. Could it be that the white- light 
rehgionists are a bit "sour- grapes" about the fact that they didn't think of a religion, before the 
Satanists, which would be enjoyable to follow; and if the truth were known, would they too 
not like to have a bit more pleasure out of life, but for fear of losing face, cannot admit it? 
Could it also be that they are afraid people will, after hearing about Satanism, tell themselves 
"This is for me - why should I continue with a religion which condemns me for everything I 
do, even though there is nothing actually wrong with it?" The Satanist thinks this is more than 
likely true. 

There is certainly much evidence that past religions are, every day, lifting more and more of 
their ridiculous restrictions. Even so, when an entire religion is based on abstinence instead of 
indulgence (as it should be) there is lMe left when it has been revised to meet the current 
needs of man. So, why waste time "buying oats for a dead horse"? 

The watchword of Satanism is indulgence instead of "abstinence" . . . but - it is not 
"compulsion". 



ON THE CHOICE 
OF 

A HUMAN SACRIFICE 

JFK 

The supposed purpose in performing the ritual of sacrifice is to throw the energy 

provided by the blood of the freshly slaughtered victim into the atmosphere of the 
Jm magical working, thereby intensifying the magician's chances of success. 

W The "white" magician assumes that since blood represents the life force, there is no 
\ better way to appease the gods or demons than to present them with suitable quantities 
J of it. Combine this rationale with the fact that a dying creature is expending an 
overabundance of adrenal and other biochemical energies, and you have what appears 
to be an unbeatable combination. 

The "white" magician, wary of the consequences involved in the killing of a human being, 
naturally utilizes birds, or other "lower" creatures in his ceremonies. It seems these 
sanctimonious wretches feel no guilt in the taking of a non- human life, as opposed to a 
human's. 

The fact of the matter is that if the "magician" is worthy of his name, he will be uninhibited 
enough to release the necessary force from his own body, instead of from an unwilling and 
undeserving victim! 

Contrary to all established magical theory, the release of this force is not effected in the actual 
spilling of blood, but in the death throes of the living creature! This discharge of bioelectrical 
energy is the very same phenomenon which occurs during any profound heightening of the 
emotions, such as: sexual orgasm, blind anger, mortal terror, consuming grief, etc. Of these 
emotions, the easiest entered into of one's own violation are sexual orgasm and anger, with 
grief mnning a close third. Remembering that the two most readily available of these three 
(sexual orgasm and anger) have been burned into man's unconscious as "sinful" by religionists, 
it is small wonder they are shunned by the "white" magician, who plods along carrying the 
greatest of all millstones of guilt! 

The inhibitive and asinine absurdity in the need to kill an innocent living creature at the high- 
point of a ritual, as practiced by erstwhile "wizards", is obviously their "lesser of the evils" 
when a discharge of energy is called for. These poor conscience- stricken fools, who have 
been calling themselves witches and warlocks, would sooner chop the head off a goat or 
chicken in an attempt to harness its death agony, than have the "blasphemous" bravery to 
masturbate in full view of the Jehovah whom they claim to deny! The only way these mystical 
cowards can ritualistically release themselves is through the agony of another's death (actually 
their own, by proxy) rather than the indulgent force which produces life! The treaders of the 
path of white light are truly the cold and the dead! No wonder these tittering pustules of 
"mystical wisdom" must stand within protective circles to bind the "evil" forces in order to 
keep themselves "safe" from attack - one good orgasm would probably kill them! 

The use of a human sacrifice in a Satanic ritual does not imply that the sacrifice is slaughtered 
"to appease the gods". Symbolically, the victim is destroyed through the working of a hex or 
curse, which in turn leads to the physical, mental or emotional destmction of the "sacrifice" in 
ways and means not attributable to the magician. 



The only time a Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be if it were to serve a two- 
fold purpose; that being to release the magician's wrath in the throwing of a curse, and more 
important, to dispose of a totally obnoxious and deserving individual. 

Under no circumstances would a Satanist sacrifice any animal or baby! For centuries, 
propagandists of the right-hand path have been prattling over the supposed sacrifices of small 
children and voluptuous maidens at the hands of diabolists. It would be thought that anyone 
reading or hearing of these heinous accounts would immediately question their authenticity, 
taking into consideration the biased sources of the stories. On the contrary, as with all "holy" 
lies which are accepted without reservation, this assumed modus operandi of the Satanists 
persists to this day! 

There are sound and logical reasons why the Satanists could not perform such sacrifices. Man, 
the animal, is the godhead to the Satanist. The purest form of carnal existence reposes in the 
bodies of animals and human children who have not grown old enough to deny themselves 
their natural desires. They can perceive things that the average adult human can never hope to. 
Therefore, the Satanist holds these beings in a sacred regard, knowing he can learn much from 
these natural magicians of the world. 

The Satanist is aware of the universal custom of the treader of the path of Agarthi; the killing 
of the god. Inasmuch as gods are always created in man's own image - and the average man 
hates what he sees in himself - the inevitable must occur: the sacrifice of the god who 
represents himself. The Satanist does not hate himself, nor the gods he might choose, and has 
no desire to destroy himself or anything for which he stands ! It is for this reason he could 
never willfully harm an animal or child. 

The question arises, "Who, then, would be considered a fit and proper human sacrifice, and 
how is one qualified to pass judgment on such a person?" The answer is brutally simple. 
Anyone who has unjustiy wronged you - one who has "gone out of his way" to hurt you - to 
deliberately cause trouble and hardship for you or those dear to you. In short, a person asking 
to be cursed by their very actions. 

When a person, by his reprehensible behavior, practically cries out to be destroyed, it is truly 
your moral obligation to indulge them their wish. The person who takes every opportunity to 
"pick on" others is often mistakenly called "sadistic". In reality, this person is a misdirected 
masochist who is working towards his own destruction. The reason a person viciously strikes 
out against you is because they are afraid of you or what you represent, or are resentful of 
your happiness. They are weak, insecure, and on extremely shaky ground when you throw 
your curse, and they make ideal human sacrifices. 

It is sometimes easy to overlook the actual wrongdoing of the victim of your curse, when one 
considers how "unhappy" a person he really is. It is not so easy, though, to retrace the 
damaging footsteps of your antagonist and make right those practical situations he or she has 
made wrong. 

The "ideal sacrifice" may be emotionally insecure, but nonetheless can, in the machinations of 
his insecurity, cause severe damage to your tranquility or sound reputation. "Mental illness", 
"nervous breakdown", "maladjustment", "anxiety neuroses", "broken homes", "sibling 
rivalry", etc., etc., ad infinitum have too long been convenient excuses for vicious and 
irresponsible actions. Anyone who says "we must try to understand" those who make life 
miserable for those undeserving of misery is aiding and abetting a social cancer! The 



apologists for these rabid humans deserve any clobberings they get at the hands of their 
charges! 

Mad dogs are destroyed, and they need help far more than the human who convenientiy made 
froths at the mouth when irrational behavior is in order! It is easy to say, "So what! - these 
people are insecure, so they can't hurt me." But the fact remains - given the opportunity they 
would destroy you! 

Therefore, you have every right to (symbolically) destroy them, and if your curse provokes 

their actual annihilation, rejoice that you have been instrumental in ridding the world of a 

pest! If your success or happiness disturbs a person - you owe him nothing! He is made to be 

trampled under foot! if people had to take the consequences of their own actions, they would think 

twice! 



LIFE AFTER DEATH 
THROUGH FULFILLMENT 
OF THE EGO 




M an is aware that he will die, someday. Other animals, when nearing death, know 

they are about to die; but it is not until death is certain that the animal senses his 
corning departure from this world. And even then he does not know exactiy what is 
entailed in dying. It is often pointed out that animals accept death gracefully, without 
fear or resistance. This is a beautiful concept, but one that only holds true in cases 
where death for the animal is unavoidable. 

When an animal is sick or injured he will fight for his life with every ounce of strength 
he has left. It is this unshakable will to live that, if man were not so "highly evolved", would 
also give him the fighting spirit he needs to stay alive. 

It is a well known fact that many people die simply because they give up and just don't care 
anymore. This is understandable if the person is very ill, with no apparent chance for 
recovery. But this often is not the case. Man has become lazy. He has learned to take the easy 
way out. Even suicide has become less repugnant to many people than any number of other 
sins. Religion is totally to blame for this. 

Death, in most religions, is touted as a great spiritual awakening - one which is prepared for 
throughout life. This concept is very appealing to one who has not had a satisfactory life; but 
to those who have experienced all the joys life has to offer, there is a great dread attached to 
dying. This is as it should be. It is this lust for life which will allow the vital person to live on 
after the inevitable death of his fleshly shell. 

History shows that men who have given their own lives in pursuit of an ideal have been 
deified for their martyrdom. Religionists and political leaders have been very crafty in laying 
their plans. By holding the martyr up as a shining example to his fellow men, they eliminate 
the common sense reaction that willful self-destruction goes against all animal logic. To the 
Satanist, martyrdom and non- personalized heroism is to be associated not with integrity, but 
with stupidity. This, of course, does not apply to the situations which involve the safety of a 
loved one. But to give one's own life for something as impersonal as a political or religious 
issue is the ultimate in masochism. 

Life is the one great indulgence; death the one great abstinence. To a person who is satisfied 
with his earthly existence, life is like a party; and no one likes to leave a good party. By the 
same token, if a person is enjoying himself here on earth he will not so readily give up this 
life for the promise of an afterlife about which he knows nothing. 

The Eastern mystical beliefs teach humans to discipline themselves against any conscious will 
for success so they might dissolve themselves into "Universal Cosmic Awareness" - anything 
to avoid good healthy self-satisfaction or honest pride in earthly accomplishments! 

It is interesting to note that the areas in which this type of belief flourishes are those where 
material gains are not easily obtainable. For this reason the predominant religious belief must 
be one which commends its followers for their rejection of material things and their avoidance 
of the use of labels which attaches a certain amount of importance to material gains. In this 




way the people can be pacified into accepting their lot, no matter how small it may be. 

Satanism uses many labels. If it were not for names, very few of us would understand 
anything in life, much less attach any significance to it; - and significance compels 
recognition, which is something everyone wants, especially the Eastern mystic who tries to 
prove to everyone he can meditate longer or stand more deprivation and pain than the next 
fellow. 

The Eastern philosophies preach the dissolution of man's ego before he can produce sins. It is 
unfathomable to the Satanist to conceive of an ego which would willfully choose denial of 
itself. 

In countries where this is used as a sop for the willingly impoverished, it is understandable 
that a philosophy which teaches the denial of the ego would serve a useful purpose - at least 
for those in power, to whom it would be detrimental if their people were discontented. But for 
anyone who has every opportunity for material gain, to choose this form of religious thought 
seems foolish, indeed! 

The Eastern mystic believes strongly in reincarnation. To a person who has virtually nothing 
in this life, the possibility that he may have been a king in a past life or may be one in the next 
life is very attractive, and does much to appease his need for self-respect. If there is nothing in 
which they can take pride in this life, they can console themselves by thinking, "there are 
always future lives." It never occurs to the believer in reincarnation that if his father, 
grandfather, and great-grandfather, etc. had developed "good karmas", by their adherence to 
the same beliefs and ethics as his present ones - then why is he now living in privation, rather 
than like a maharajah? 

Belief in reincarnation provides a beautiful fantasy world in which a person can find the 
proper avenue of ego-expression, but at the same time claim to have dissolved his ego. This is 
emphasized by the roles people choose for themselves in their past or future lives. 

Believers in reincarnation do not always choose an honorable character. If the person is of a 
highly respectable and conservative nature, he will often choose a colorful rogue or gangster, 
thereby fulfilling his alter- ego. Or, a woman who has much social status may pick a harlot or 
famous courtesan for the characterization of herself in a past life. 

If people were able to divorce themselves from the stigma attached to personal ego- 
fulfillment, they would not need to play self- deceitful games such as belief in reincarnation as 
a means of satisfying their natural need for ego -fulfillment. 

The Satanist believes in complete gratification of his ego. Satanism, in fact, is the only 
religion which advocates the intensification or encouragement of the ego. Only if a person's 
own ego is sufficiency fulfilled, can he afford to be kind and complimentary to others, 
without robbing himself of his self-respect. We generally think of a braggart as a person with 
a large ego; in reality, his bragging results from a need to satisfy his impoverished ego. 

Religionists have kept their followers in line by suppressing their egos. By making their 
followers feel inferior, the awesomeness of their god is insured. Satanism encourages its 
members to develop a good strong ego because it gives them the self-respect necessary for a 
vital existence in this life. 



If a person has been vital throughout his life and has fought to the end for his earthly 
existence, it is this ego which will refuse to die, even after the expiration of the flesh which 
housed it. Young children are to be admired for their driving enthusiasm for life. This is 
exemplified by the small child who refuses to go to bed when there is something exciting 
going on, and when once put to bed, will sneak down the stairs to peek through the curtain 
and watch. It is this child- like vitality that will allow the Satanist to peek through the curtain 
of darkness and death and remain earthbound. 

Self-sacrifice is not encouraged by the Satanic religion. Therefore, unless death comes as an 
indulgence because of extreme circumstances which make the termination of life a welcome 
relief from the unendurable earthly existence, suicide is frowned upon by the Satanic religion. 

Religious martyrs have taken their own lives, not because life was intolerable for them, but to 
use their supreme sacrifice as a tool to further the religious belief. We must assume, then, that 
suicide, if done for the sake of the church, is condoned and even encouraged - even though 
their scriptures label it a sin - because religious martyrs of the past have always been deified. 

It is rather curious that the only time suicide is considered sinful by other religions is when it 
comes as an indulgence. 



RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS 



JSl The highest of all hohdays in the Satanic rehgion is the date of one's own birth. This 

^■fe^is in direct contradiction to the holy of holy days of other religions, which deify a 
Jm particular god who has been created in an anthropomorphic form of their own image, 
£ thereby showing that the ego is not really buried. 

\ The Satanist feels: "Why not really be honest and if you are going to create a god in 
J your image, why not create that god as yourself." Every man is a god if he chooses to 
recognize himself as one. So, the Satanist celebrates his own birthday as the most 
important holiday of the year. After all, aren't you happier about the fact that you were bom 
than you are about the birth of someone you have never even met? Or for that matter, aside 
from religious hohdays, why pay higher tribute to the birthday of a president or to a date in 
history than we do to the day we were brought into this greatest of all worlds? 

Despite the fact that some of us may not have been wanted, or at least were not particularly 
planned, we're glad, even if no one else is, that we're here! You should give yourself a pat on 
the back, buy yourself whatever you want, treat yourself like the king (or god) that you are, 
and generally celebrate your birthday with as much pomp and ceremony as possible. 

After one's own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween 
(or All Hallows' Eve). 

St. Walpurgis - or Walpurga, or Walburga, depending upon the time and area in which one is 
referring to her - was bom in Sussex about the end of the Seventh or the beginning of the 
Eighth Century, and was educated at Winburn, Dorset, where after taking the veil, she 
remained for twenty- five years. She then, at the instance of her uncle, St. Boniface, and her 
brother, St. Wilibald, set out along with some other nuns to found religious houses in 
Germany. Her first settlement was at Bischofsheim in the diocese of Mainz, and two years 
later (754 A.D.) she became abbess of the Benedictine nunnery at Heidenheim, within her 
brother Wilibald's diocese of Eichstadt in Bavaria, where another brother, Winebald, had at 
the same time also been made head of a monastery. On the death of Winebald in 760 she 
succeeded him in his charge, retaining the superintendence of both houses until her death on 
February 25, 779. Her relics were translated to Eichstadt, where she was laid in a hollow rock, 
from which exuded a kind of bituminous oil, afterwards known as Walpurgis oil, regarded as 
having miraculous efficacy against disease. The cave became a place of pilgrimage, and a 
great church was built over the spot. She is commemorated at various times, but principally 
on May 1st, her day taking the place of an earlier Pagan festival. Amazingly enough, all of 
this rigmarole was found necessary simply to condone the continuance of the most important 
Pagan festival of the year - the grand climax of the spring equinox! 

The Eve of May has been memorialized as the night that all of the demons, specters, afreets, 
and banshees would come forth and hold their wild revels, symbolizing the fruition of the 
spring equinox. 

Halloween - All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Day - falls on October 31st or November 1st. 
Originally, All Hallows' Eve was one of the great fire festivals of Britain at the time of the 
Druids. In Scotland it was associated with the time when the spirits of the dead, the demons, 
witches, and sorcerers were unusually active and propitious. Paradoxically, All Hallows' Eve 



was also the night when young people performed magical rituals to determine their future 
marriage partners. The youth of the villages carried on with much merry-making and sensual 
revelry, but the older people took great care to safeguard their homes from the evil spirits, 
witches, and demons who had exceptional power that night. 

The solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated as holidays, as they herald the first day of the 
seasons. The difference between a solstice and an equinox is a semantic one defining the 
relationship between the sun, moon, and the fixed stars. The solstice applies to summer and 
winter; the equinox refers to autumn and spring. The summer solstice is in June, and the 
winter solstice is in December. The autumn equinox is in September, and the spring equinox 
is in March. Both the equinoxes and the solstices vary a day or two from year to year, 
depending on the lunar cycle at the time, but usually fall on the 21st or 22nd of the month. 
Five to six weeks after these days the legendary Satanic revels are celebrated. 



THE BLACK MASS 




N o other single device has been associated with Satanism as much as the black mass. 

To say that the most blasphemous of all religious ceremonies is nothing more than a 
literary invention is certainly a statement which needs qualifying - but nothing could 
be truer. 

The popular concept of the black mass is thus: a defrocked priest stands before an altar 
consisting of a nude woman, her legs spread-eagled and vagina thrust open, each of her 
outstretched fists grasping a black candle made from the fat of unbaptized babies, and 
a chalice containing the urine of a prostitute (or blood) reposing on her belly. An inverted 
cross hangs above the altar, and triangular hosts of ergot- laden bread or black- stained turnip 
are methodically blessed as the priest dutifully slips them in and out of the altar- lady's labia. 
Then, we are told, an invocation to Satan and various demons is followed by an array of 
prayers and psalms chanted backwards or interspersed with obscenities ... all performed 
within the confines of a "protective" pentagram drawn on the floor. If the Devil appears he is 
invariably in the form of a rather eager man wearing the head of a black goat upon his 
shoulders. Then follows a potpourri of flagellation, prayer-book burning, cunnilingus, fellatio, 
and general hindquarters kissing - all done to a background of ribald recitations from the Holy 
Bible, and audible expectorations on the cross! If a baby can be slaughtered during the ritual, 
so much the better; for as everyone knows, this is the favorite sport of the Satanist! 

If this sounds repugnant, then the success of the reports of the black mass, in keeping the 
devout in church, is easy to understand. No "decent" person could fail to side with the 
inquisitors when told of these blasphemies. The propagandists of the church did their job well, 
mforrning the public at one time or another of the heresies and heinous acts of the Pagans, 
Cathars, Bogomils, Templars and others who, because of their dualistic philosophies and 
sometimes Satanic logic, had to be eradicated. 

The stories of unbaptized babies being stolen by Satanists for use in the mass were not only 
effective propaganda measures, but also provided a constant source of revenue for the 
Church, in the form of baptism fees. No Christian mother would, upon hearing of these 
diabolical kidnappings, refrain from getting her child properly baptized, post haste. 

Another facet of man's nature was apparent in the fact that the writer or artist with lewd 
thoughts could exercise his most obscene predilections in the portrayal of the activities of 
heretics. The censor who views all pornography so that he will know what to warn others of is 
the modem equivalent of the medieval chronicler of the obscene deeds of the Satanists (and, 
of course, their modem journalistic counterparts). It is believed that the most complete library 
of pornography in the world is owned by the Vatican! 

The kissing of the Devil's behind during the traditional black mass is easily recognized as the 
forerunner of the modem term used to describe one who will, through appealing to another's 
ego, gain materially from him. As all Satanic ceremonies were performed toward very real or 
material goals, the oscularum infame (or kiss of shame) was considered a symbolic requisite 
towards earthly, rather than spiritual, success. 

The usual assumption is that the Satanic ceremony or service is always called a black mass. A 
black mass is not the magical ceremony practiced by Satanists. The Satanist would only 




employ the use of a black mass as a form of psychodrama. Furthermore, a black mass does 
not necessarily imply that the performers of such are Satanists. A black mass is essentially a 
parody of the religious service of the Roman Catholic Church, but can be loosely applied to a 
satire on any religious ceremony. 

To the Satanist, the black mass, in its blaspheming of orthodox rites, is nothing more than a 
redundancy. The services of all established religions are actually parodies of old rituals 
performed by the worshippers of the earth and the flesh. In attempts to de-sexualize and de- 
humanize the Pagan beliefs, later men of spiritual faith whitewashed the honest meanings 
behind the rituals into the bland euphemisms now considered to be the "true mass". Even if 
the Satanist were to spend each night performing a black mass, he would no more be 
performing a travesty than the devout churchgoer who unwittingly attends his own "black 
mass" - his spoof on the honest and emotionally- sound rites of Pagan antiquity. 

Any ceremony considered a black mass must effectively shock and outrage, as this seems to 
be the measure of its success. In the Middle Ages, blaspheming the holy church was shocking. 
Now, however, the Church does not present the awesome image it did during the inquisition. 
The traditional black mass is no longer the outrageous spectacle to the dilettante or renegade 
priest that it once was. If the Satanist wishes to create a ritual to blaspheme an accepted 
institution, for the purpose of psychodrama, he is careful to choose one that is not in vogue to 
parody. Thus, he is truly stepping on a sacred cow. 

A black mass, today, would consist of the blaspheming of such "sacred" topics as Eastern 
mysticism, psychiatry, the psychedelic movement, ultra- liberalism, etc. Patriotism would be 
championed, drugs and their gurus would be defiled, acultural militants would be deified, and 
the decadence of ecclesiastical theologies might even be given a Satanic boost. 

The Satanic magus has always been the catalyst for the dichotomy necessary in molding 
popular beliefs, and in this case a ceremony in the nature of a black mass may serve a far- 
reaching magical purpose. 

In the year 1666, some rather interesting events occurred in France. With the death of 
Francois Mansart, the architect of the trapezoid, whose geometries were to become the 
prototype of the haunted house, the Palace of Versailles was being constructed, in accordance 
with his plans. The last of the glamorous priestesses of Satan, Jeanne -Marie Bouvier 
(Madame Guyon) was to be overshadowed by a shrewd opportunist and callous business- 
woman named Catharine Deshayes, otherwise known as LaVoisin. Here was an erstwhile 
beautician who, while dabbling in abortions and purveying the most efficient poisons to ladies 
desirous of eliminating unwanted husbands or lovers, found in the lurid accounts of the 
"messes noir" a proverbial brainstorm. 

It is safe to say that 1666 was the year of the first "commercial" black mass! In the region 
south of St. Denis, which is now called LaGarenne, a great walled house was purchased by 
LaVoisin and fitted with dispensaries, cells, laboratories, and ... a chapel. Soon it became de 
rigueur for royalty and lesser dilettantes to attend and participate in the very type of service 
mentioned earlier in this chapter. The organized fraud perpetrated in these ceremonies has 
become indelibly marked in history as the "true black mass". 

When LaVoisin was arrested on March 13, 1679 (in the Church of Our Blessed Lady of Good 
Tidings, incidentally), the die had already been cast. The degraded activities of LaVoisin had 
stifled the majesty of Satanism for many years to come. 



The Satanism- for- fan- and- games fad next appeared in England in the middle 18th Century in 
the form of Sir Francis Dashwood's Order of the Medmanham Franciscans, popularly called 
The Hell-Fire Club. While eliminating the blood, gore, and baby- fat candles of the previous 
century's masses, Sir Francis managed to conduct rituals replete with good dirty fun, and 
certainly provided a colorful and harmless form of psychodrama for many of the leading 
lights of the period. An interesting sideline of Sir Francis, which lends a clue to the climate of 
the Hell- Fire Club, was a group called the Dilettanti Club, of which he was the founder. 

It was the 19th Century that brought a whitewashing to Satanism, in the feeble attempts of 
"white" magicians trying to perform "black" magic. This was a very paradoxical period for 
Satanism, with writers such as Baudelaire and Huysmans who, despite their apparent 
obsession with evil, seemed nice enough fellows. The Devil developed his Luciferian 
personality for the public to see, and gradually evolved into a sort of drawing-room 
gentleman. This was the era of "experts" on the black arts, such as Eliphas Levi and countless 
trance- mediums who, with their carefully bound spirits and demons, have also succeeded in 
binding the minds of many who call themselves parapsychologists to this day! 

As far as Satanism is concerned, the closest outward signs of this were the neo- Pagan rites 
conducted by MacGregor Mathers' Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Aleister 
Crowley's later Order of the Silver Star (A. . A.'. - Argentinum Astrum) and Order of Oriental 
Templars (O.T.O.)*, which paranoiacally denied any association with Satanism, despite 
Crowley's self-imposed image of the beast of revelation. Aside from some rather charming 
poetry and a smattering of magical bric-a-brac, when not climbing mountains Crowley spent 
most of his time as a poseur par excellence and worked overtime to be wicked. Like his 
contemporary, Rev.(?) Montague Summers, Crowley obviously spent a large part of his life 
with his tongue jammed firmly into his cheek, but his followers, today, are somehow able to 
read esoteric meaning into his every word. 

Perennially concurrent with these societies were the sex clubs using Satanism as a rationale - 
that persists today, for which tabloid newspaper writers may give thanks. 

If it appears that the black mass developed from a literary invention of the church, to a 
depraved commercial actuality, to a psychodrama for dilettantes and iconoclasts, to an ace in 
the hole for popular media . . . then where does it fit into the true nature of Satanism - and 
who was practicing Satanic magic in those years beyond 1666? 

The answer to this riddle lies in another. Is the person generally considered to be a Satanist 
really practicing Satanism in its true sense, or rather from the point of view taken by the 
opinion makers of heavenly persuasion? It has often been said, and rightiy so, that all of the 
books about the Devil have been written by the agents of God. It is, therefore, quite easy to 
understand how a certain breed of devil worshippers was created through the inventions of 
theologians. This erstwhile "evil" character is not necessarily practicing true Satanism. Nor is 
he a living embodiment of the element of untrammeled pride or majesty of self which gave 
the post- Pagan world the churchman's definition of evil. He is instead the by-product of later 
and more elaborate propaganda. 

The pseudo- Satanist has always managed to appear throughout modem history, with his black 
masses of varying degrees of blasphemy; but the real Satanist is not quite so easily recognized 
as such. 

It would be an over- simplification to say that every successful man and woman on earth is, 



without knowing it, a practicing Satanist; but the thirst for earthly success and its ensuing 
realization are certainly grounds for Saint Peter turning thumbs down. If the rich man's entry 
into heaven seems as difficult as the camel's attempt to go through the eye of a needle; if the 
love of money is the root of all evil; then we must at least assume the post powerful men on 
earth to be the most Satanic. This applies to financiers, industrialists, popes, poets, dictators, 
and all assorted opinion- makers and field marshals of the world's activities. 

Occasionally, through "leakages", one of the enigmatic men or women of earth will be found 
to have "dabbled" in the black arts. These, of course, are brought to light as in the "mystery 
men" of history. Names like Rasputin, Zaharoff, Cagliostro, Rosenberg and their ilk are links 
- clues, so to speak, of the true legacy of Satan ... a legacy which transcends ethnic, racial, 
and economic differences and temporal ideologies, as well. The Satanist has always ruled the 
earth . . . and always will, by whatever name he is called. 

One thing stands sure: the standards, philosophy and practices set forth on these pages are 
those employed by the most self- realized and powerful humans on earth. In the secret 
thoughts of each man and woman, still motivated by sound and unclouded minds, resides the 
potential of the Satanist, as always has been. The sign of the horns shall appear to many, now, 
rather than the few; and the magician will stand forth that he may be recognized.

THE BOOK OF BELIAL 

THE MASTERY OF THE EARTH 

The greatest appeal of magic is not in its application, but in its esoteric meanderings. The 
element of mystery which so heavily enshrouds the practice of the black arts has been 
fostered, deliberately or out of ignorance, by those who often claim the highest expertise in 
such matters. If the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, then established 
occultists would do well as maze -makers. The basic principles of ceremonial magic have been 
relegated for so long to infinitely classified bits of scholastic mysticism, that the would-be 
wizard becomes the victim of the very art of misdirection which he, himself, should be 
employing! An analogy may be drawn of the student of applied psychology who, though 
knowing all of the answers, cannot make friends. 

What good is a study of falsehoods, unless everyone believes in falsehoods? Many, of course, 
do believe in falsehoods, but still act according to natural law. It is upon this premise that 
Satanic magic is based. This is a primer - a basic text on materialistic magic. It is a Satanic 
McGuffey's Reader. 

Belial means "without a master", and symbolizes true independence, self-sufficiency, and 
personal accomplishment. Belial represents the earth element, and herein will be found magic 
with both feet on the ground - real, hard-core, magical procedure - not mystical platitudes 
devoid of objective reason. Probe no longer. Here is bedrock! 



THE THEORY AND PRACTICE 
OF 

SATANIC MAGIC 



(Definition and Purpose) 



jfl 1 hii definition of magic, as used in this book, is: 'The change in situations or events 
^flBkin accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be 
W unchangeable." This admittedly leaves a large area for personal interpretation. It will be 
£ said, by some, that these instructions and procedures are nothing more than applied 
W psychology, or scientific fact, called by "magical" terminology - until they arrive at a 
\ passage in the text that is "based on no known scientific finding". It is for this reason 
] that no attempt has been made to limit the explanations set forth to a set nomenclature. 
Magic is never totally scientifically explainable, but science has always been, at one 
time or another, considered magic. 

There is no difference between "White" and "Black" magic, except in the smug hypocrisy, 
guilt- ridden righteousness, and self-deceit of the "White" magician himself. In the classical 
religious tradition, "White" magic is performed for altruistic, benevolent, and "good" 
purposes; while "Black" magic is used for self-aggrandizement, personal power, and "evil" 
purposes. No one on earth ever pursued occult studies, metaphysics, yoga, or any other "white 
light" concept, without ego gratification and personal power as a goal. It just so happens that 
some people enjoy wearing hair shirts, and others prefer velvet or silk. What is pleasure to 
one, is pain to another, and the same applies to "good" and "evil". Every practitioner of 
witchcraft is convinced that he or she is doing the "right" thing. 

Magic falls into two categories, ritual or ceremonial, and non- ritual or manipulative. Ritual 
magic consists of the performance of a formal ceremony, taking place, at least in part, within 
the confines of an area set aside for such purposes and at a specific time. Its main function is 
to isolate the otherwise dissipated adrenal and other emotionally induced energy, and convert 
it into a dynamically transmittable force. It is purely an emotional, rather than intellectual, act. 
Any and all intellectual activity must take place before the ceremony, not during it. This type 
of magic is sometimes known as "greater magic". 

Non- ritual or manipulative magic, sometimes called 'Lesser magic", consists of the wile and 
guile obtained through various devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can 
create "change, in accordance with one's will". In olden times this would be called 
"fascination", "glamour", or the "evil eye". 

Most of the victims of the witch trials were not witches. Often the victims were eccentric old 
women who were either senile or did not conform to society. Others were exceptionally 
attractive women who turned the heads of the men in power, and were not responsive to their 
advances. The real witches were rarely executed, or even brought to trial, as they were 
proficient in the art of enchantment and could charm the men and save their own lives. Most 
of the real witches were sleeping with the inquisitors. This is the origin of the word 
"glamour". The antiquated meaning of glamour is witchcraft. The most important asset to the 
modem witch is her ability to be alluring, or to utilize glamour. The word "fascination" has a 
similarly occult origin. Fascination was the term applied to the evil eye. To fix a person's 
gaze, in other words, fascinate, was to curse them with the evil eye. Therefore, if a woman 
had the ability to fascinate men, she was regarded as a witch. 



had the ability to fascinate men, she was regarded as a witch. 

Earning to effectively utilize the command to look, is an integral part of a witch's or 
warlock's training. To manipulate a person, you must first be able to attract and hold his 
attention. The three methods by which the command to look can be accomplished are the 
utilization of sex, sentiment, or wonder, or any combination of these. A witch must, honestly, 
decide into which category she most naturally falls. The first category, that of sex, is self- 
evident. If a woman is attractive or sexually appealing, she should do everything in her power 
to make herself as enticing as possible, thereby using sex as her most powerful tool. Once she 
has gained the man's attention, by using her sex appeal, she is free to manipulate him to her 
will. The second category is sentiment. Usually older woman fit into this category. This 
would include the "cookie lady" type witch, who might live in a little cottage, and be thought 
of by people as being a bit eccentric. Children are usually enchanted by the fantasy that this 
type of witch can provide for them, and young adults seek her out for her sage -like advice. 
Through their innocence, children can recognize her magical power. By conforming to an 
image of the sweet little old lady next door, she can employ the art of misdirection to 
accomplish her goals. The third category is the wonder theme. This category would apply to 
the woman who is strange or awesome in her appearance. By making her strange appearance 
work for her, she can manipulate people simply because they are fearful of the consequences 
should they not do as she asks. 

Many women fit into more than one of these categories. For example, the young girl who has 
an appearance of freshness and innocence, but at the same time is very sexy, combines sex 
appeal with sinister overtones, uses sex and wonder. After evaluating her assets, each witch 
must decide into which category or combination of categories she fits, and then utilize these 
assets in their proper form. 

To be a successful warlock, a man must similarly fit himself into the proper category. The 
handsome or sexually appealing man would, naturally, fit into the first category - sex. The 
second, or sentiment category would apply to the older man who has, perhaps, an elfin or 
forest wizard appearance. The sweet old grandpa (often a dirty old man!) would also be in the 
sentiment category. The third type would be the man who presents a sinister or diabolic 
appearance. Each of these men would apply his particular brand of the command to look, in 
much the same way as the women previously described. 

Visual imagery utilized for emotional reaction is certainly the most important device 
incorporated in the practice of lesser magic. Anyone who is foolish enough to say "looks don't 
mean a thing" is indeed deluded. Good looks are unnecessary, but "looks" certainly are 
needed! 

Odor is another important manipulative factor in lesser magic. Remember, animals fear and 
distrust anyone or anything that doesn't smell! And even though we may, as human animals, 
deny many of the judgments based on this sense consciously, we still are motivated by our 
sense of smell just as surely as any all- fours animal. If you are a man, and wish to enchant a 
woman, allow the natural secretions of your body to pervade the atmosphere immediately 
around you, and work in animalistic contrast to the vestments of social politeness that you 
wear upon your back. If you, as a woman, wish to bewitch a man, do not fear that you might 
"offend" simply because the oils and fragrances of your flesh have not been scrubbed away, 
or that place between your thighs is not dry and sterile. These natural odors are the sexual 
stimulants which nature, in her magical wisdom, has provided. 



The sentiment stimulants are those odors that will appeal to pleasant memories and nostalgia. 
The enchanting of a man, through his stomach, is first established by the smell of cooking! A 
"sentiment" type of witch will find this one of the most useful of all charms. It is not so 
facetious to dwell upon the technique of the man who wished to charm the young lady who 
had been displaced from her home of childhood joys, which happened to be a fishing village. 
Wise to the ways of lesser magic, he neatly tucked a mackerel into his trousers pocket, and 
reaped the rewards that great fondness may often bring. 



THE THREE TYPES 
OF 

SATANIC RITUAL 



JFK 

jjja There are three types of ceremony incoiporated in the practice of Satanic magic. Each 

^■fef of these correspond to a basic human emotion. The first of these we shall call a sex 
Jm ritual. 

9 A sex ritual is what is commonly known as a love charm or spell. The purpose in 
\ performing such a ritual is to create desire on the part of the person whom you desire, 
] or to summon a sex partner to fulfill your desires. If you have no specific person or 
type of person in mind strong enough to cause direct sexual feeling culminating in 
orgasm, you will not succeed in performing as successful working. The reason for this is that 
even if the ritual was successful, by accident, what good would it serve if you could not take 
advantage of your eventual opportunity because of lack of stimulation or desire? It is easy to 
confuse enchantment for your ulterior motives, with spell- casting to satisfy your sexual 
desires. 



Enchantment for self-aggrandizement, when accompanied by ceremonial magic, falls into the 
category of either the compassion or the destruction ritual, or possibly both. If you want or 
need something so badly you are sad or feel much anguish without it, without causing hurt on 
another's part, then this would incorporate a compassion ritual to increase your power. If you 
wish to enchant or entrap a deserving victim for your own purposes, you would employ a 
destruction ritual. These formulas are to be adhered to, as applying the wrong type of ritual 
towards a desired result can lead to trouble of a complicated nature. 

A good example of this is the girl who finds herself plagued by a relentless suitor. If she has 
done little to encourage him, then she should recognize him for the psychic vampire he is, and 
let him play his masochistic role. If, however, she has enchanted him frivolously, giving him 
every encouragement and then finds herself a steady object of sexual desire, much to her 
dismay, she has no one to blame but herself. Such exercises are only ego boosts, borne of an 
indoctrination of ego denial which makes these little bewitchments necessary. The Satanist 
has enough ego strength to use enchantments for her own sexual gratification, or to gain 
power or success of a specific nature. 

The second type of ritual is of a compassionate nature. The compassion, or sentiment, ritual is 
performed for the purpose of helping others, or helping oneself. Health, domestic happiness, 
business activities, material success, and scholastic prowess are but a few of the situations 
covered in a compassion ritual. It might be said that this form of ceremony could fall into the 
realm of genuine charity, bearing in mind that "charity begins at home". 

The third motivating force is that of destruction. This is a ceremony used for anger, 
annoyance, disdain, contempt, or just plain hate. It is known as a hex, curse, or destroying 
agent. 

One of the greatest of all fallacies about the practice of ritual magic is the notion that one 
must believe in the powers of magic before one can be harmed or destroyed by them. Nothing 
could be farther from the truth, as the most receptive victims of curses have always been the 
greatest scoffers. The reason is frighteningly simple. The uncivilized tribesman is the first to 



run to his nearest witch-doctor or shaman when he feels a curse has been placed upon him by 
an enemy. The threat and presence of harm is with him consciously, and belief in the power of 
the curse is so strong that he will take every precaution against it. Thus, through the 
application of sympathetic magic, he will counteract any harm that might come his way. This 
man is watching his step, and not taking any chances. 

On the other hand, the "enlightened" man, who doesn't place any stock in such "superstition", 
relegates his instinctive fear of the curse to his unconscious, thereby nourishing it into a 
phenomenally destructive force that will multiply with each succeeding misfortune. Of course, 
every time a new setback occurs, the non-believer will automatically deny any connection 
with the curse, especially to himself. The emphatic conscious denial of the potential of the 
curse is the very ingredient that will create its success, through setting-up of accident prone 
situations. In many instances, the victim will deny any magical significance to his fate, even 
unto his dying gasp - although the magician is perfectly satisfied, so long as his desired results 
occur. It must be remembered that it matters not whether anyone attaches any significance to 
your working, so long as the results of the working are in accordance with your will. The 
super- logician will always explain the connection of the magical ritual to the end result as 
"coincidence". 

Whether magic is performed for constructive or destructive purposes, the success of the 
operation is dependent on the receptivity of the person who is to receive the blessing or curse, 
as the case may be. In the case of a sex or compassion ritual, it helps if the recipient has faith 
and believes in magic, but the victim of a hex or curse is much more prone to destruction if he 
does not believe in it! So long as man knows the meaning of fear, he will need the ways and 
means to defend himself against his fears. No one knows everything, and as long as there is 
wonder, there will always be an apprehension of the unknown, where there are potentially 
dangerous forces. It is this natural fear of the unknown, a first cousin to the fascination 
towards the unknown, that impels the man of logic towards his very explanations. Obviously, 
the man of science is motivated to discovery by his very sense of wonder. And yet, how sad 
that this man who calls himself logical is often the last to recognize the essence of ritual 
magic. 

If religious faith can make bleeding wounds appear on the body in approximation to the 
wounds supposedly inflicted on Christ, it is called stigmata. These wounds appear as a result 
of compassion driven to an emotionally violent extreme. Why, then, should there be any 
doubt as to the destructive extremes of fear and terror. The so-called demons have the power 
to destroy in a flesh rending manner, theoretically, as much as a handful of nails, long rusted 
away, can create blood- dripping ecstasy in a person convinced he is hooked upon the cross of 
Calvary. 

Therefore, never attempt to convince the skeptic upon whom you wish to place a curse. Allow 
him to scoff. To enlighten him would lessen your chance of success. Listen with benign 
assurance as he laughs at your magic, knowing his days are filled with turmoil all the while. If 
he is despicable enough, by Satan's grace, he might even die - laughing! 

A WORD OF WARNING! 
TO THOSE WHO WOULD PRACTICE THESE ARTS - 

Concerning Sex or Take full advantage of spells and charms that work; if you be a 

Lust: man, plunge your erect member into her with lascivious delight; if 

you be a woman, open wide your loins in lewd anticipation. 



Concerning Be resolved that you '11 have no regrets at the expense of the help 

Compassion: that you have given others, should their new-found blessings place 

an obstacle in your path. Be grateful for things that come to you 

through the use of magic. 

Concerning Be certain you do not care if the intended victim lives or dies, 

Destruction: before you throw your curse, and having caused their destruction, 

revel, rather than feel remorse. 



HEED WELL THESE RULES - OR IN 
EACH CASE YOU WILL SEE A REVERSAL 
OF YOUR DESIRES WHICH WILL 
HARM, RATHER THAN HELP, YOU! 



THE RITUAL, OR 
"INTELLECTUAL DECOMPRESSION", 
CHAMBER 




A magical ceremony may be performed by oneself or in a group, but the advantages 
of each should be made clear. 

A group ritual is certainly much more of a reinforcement of faith, and an instillation of 
power, than is a private ceremony. The massing together of persons who are dedicated 
to a common philosophy is bound to insure a renewal of confidence in the power of 
magic. The pageantry of religion consistentiy becomes a solitary situation it reaches 
into that realm of self-denial which runs concurrent with anti- social behavior. 

It is for this reason that the Satanist should attempt to seek out others with whom to engage in 
these ceremonies. 

In the case of a curse or destruction ritual, it sometimes helps the magician if his desires are 
intensified by other members of the group. There is nothing in this type of ceremony which 
would lead to embarrassment on the part of those conducting a ritual of this sort, since anger 
and the symbolic destruction of the intended victim are the essential ingredients. 

On the other hand, a compassion ritual, with its unashamed shedding of tears, or a sex ritual, 
with its masturbatory and orgasmic overtones, would most likely succeed best if privately 
performed. 

There is no place for self- consciousness in the ritual chamber, unless that very self- 
consciousness is an integral part of the role being played, and can be used to good advantage - 
i.e.: the shame felt by a prudent woman serving as an altar, who, through her embarrassment, 
feels sexual stimulation. 

Even in a totally personalized ritual, however, the standardized preliminary invocations and 
devices should be employed before the intimate fantasies and acting out occur. The formal 
part of the ritual can be performed in the same room or chamber as the personalized working - 
or, the formal ceremony in one place, the personal in another. The beginning and end of the 
ritual must be conducted within the confines of the ritual chamber containing the symbolic 
devices (altar, chalice, etc.). 

The formalized beginning and end of the ceremony acts as a dogmatic, anti- intellectual 
device, the purpose of which is to disassociate the activities and frame of reference of the 
outside world from that of the ritual chamber, where the whole will must be employed. This 
facet of the ceremony is most important to the intellectual, as he especially requires the 
"decompression chamber" effect of the chants, bells, candles, and other trappings, before he 
can put his pure and willful desires to work for himself, in the projection and utilization of his 
imagery. 

The "intellectual decompression chamber" of the Satanic temple might be considered a 
training school for temporary ignorance, as are all religious services! The difference is that 
the Satanist knows he is practicing a form of contrived ignorance in order to expand his will, 
whereas another religionist doesn't - or if he does know, he practices that form of self-deceit 




which forbids such recognition. His ego is already too shaky from his religious inculcation to 
allow himself to admit to such a thing as self-imposed ignorance! 



THE INGREDIENTS USED 
IN THE PERFORMANCE 
OF SATANIC MAGIC 



A. Desire 



Sm -I- he first ingredient in the performance of a ritual is desire, otherwise known as 
^■t^motivation, temptation, or emotional persuasion. If you do not truly desire any end 
Jm result, you should not attempt to perform a working. 

9 There is no such thing as a "practice" working, and the only way that a magician could 
\ do "tricks" such as moving inanimate objects, would be to have a strong emotional 
) need to do so. It is true that if the magician wishes to gain power through impressing 
others with his feats of magic, he must produce tangible proof of his ability. The 
Satanic concept of magic, however, fails to find gratification in the proving of magical 
prowess. 

The Satanist performs his ritual to insure the outcome of his desires, and he would not waste 
his time nor force of will on something so inconclusive as rolling a pencil off a table, etc. 
through the application of magic. The amount of energy needed to levitate a teacup 
(genuinely) would be of sufficient force to place an idea in a group of people's heads half-way 
across the earth, in turn, motivating them in accordance with your will. The Satanist knows 
that even if you succeeded in lifting the teacup from the table, it would be assumed that 
trickery was used anyway. Therefore, if the Satanist wants to float objects in mid- air, he uses 
wires, mirrors, or other devices, and saves his force for self-aggrandizement. All "gifted" 
mediums and white- light mystics practice pure and applied stage magic, with their blindfolds 
and sealed envelopes, and any fairly competent stage magician, carnival worker, or lodge-hall 
entertainer can duplicate the same effect - although lacking, perhaps, the sanctimonious 
"spiritual" overtones. 

A little child learns that if he wishes for something hard enough, it will come true. This is 
meaningful. Wishing indicates desire, whereas prayer is accompanied by apprehension. 
Scripture has twisted desire into lust, covetousness, and greed. Be as a child, and do not stifle 
desire, lest you lose touch with the first ingredient in the performance of magic. Be led into 
temptation, and take that which tempts, whenever you can! 



THE INGREDIENTS USED 
IN THE PERFORMANCE 
OF SATANIC MAGIC 



B. Timing 



flff In every successful situation, one of the most important ingredients is the proper 
iBt^timing. In the performance of a magical ritual, timing can mean success or failure to an 
Jm even greater extent. The best time to cast your spell or charm, hex or curse, is when 
£ your target is at his most receptive state. Receptivity to the will of the magician is 
W assured when the recipient is as passive as possible. No matter how strong-willed one 
\ is, he is naturally passive while he is asleep; therefore, the best time to throw your 
j magical energy towards your target is when he or she sleeps. 

There are certain periods of the sleep cycle that are better than others for susceptibility to 
outside influences. When a person is normally fatigued from a day's activities, he will "sleep 
like a log" until his mind and body are rested. This period of profound sleep usually lasts 
about four to six hours, after which the period of "dream sleep" occurs which lasts two or 
three hours, or until awakening. It is during this "dream sleep" that the mind is most receptive 
to outside or unconscious influence. 

Let us assume the magician wishes to cast a spell on a person who would usually retire at 1 1 
o'clock in the evening, and rise at 7 o'clock in the morning. The most effective time to 
perform a ritual would be about 5 o'clock in the morning, or two hours before the recipient 
awakens. 

It is to be emphasized that the magician must be at his peak of efficiency, as he represents the 
"sending" factor when he performs his ritual. Traditionally speaking, witches and sorcerers 
are night people, and understandably so. What better schedule on which to live, for the 
sending of thoughts towards unsuspecting sleepers! If only people were aware of the thoughts 
injected into their minds while they slept! The dream state is the birthplace of much of the 
future. Great thoughts are manifest upon awakening, and the mind that retains, in conscious 
form, these thoughts, shall produce much. But he who is guided by thoughts unrecognized is 
led into situations that will later be interpreted as "fate", "God's will", or accident. 

There are other times in each person's day that lend themselves to the receiving of the will of 
the wizard. Those times when day-dreaming or boredom ensue, or when time hangs heavy, 
are fertile periods of suggestibility. 

If a woman is the target for your spell, do not forget the importance of the menstrual cycle. If 
man were not dulled through his stifling evolutionary development, he would know, as an all- 
fours animal knows, when the female was most sexually inclined. Man's snout, however 
unsullied by cheap opiates, is not normally equipped to ferret out such tell-tale erotic scents. 
Even if he were so endowed with such olfactory powers, the object of his quest would most 
likely "throw him off the scent" through the use of massive doses of perfumery to cover and 
smother the "offending" effluvium, or eliminate detection completely, by the astringent action 
of powerful deodorants. 



Despite these discouraging factors, man is still motivated to desire or be repelled, as the case 
may be, by his unconscious recognition of the change in woman's body chemistry. This is 
accomplished in the form of a sensory cue, which is olfactory in its nature. To go backwards, 
in what would amount to a return to the all- fours animal, would seem to be the best exercise 
for the conscious application of these powers, but to the squeamish might smack of 
lycanthropy. There is, however, an easier way, and that is to simply ascertain the dates and 
frequency of the menstrual cycle of the woman who is your target. It is immediately before 
and after the period itself that the average woman is most sexually approachable. Therefore, 
the magician will find the sleep period during these times most effective for the instillation of 
thoughts or motivations of a sexual nature. 

Witches and sorceresses have a much greater range of time in which to cast their spells 
toward the men of their choice. Because man is more consistent in his sexual drives than 
woman (although there are many women with equal or even greater lusts), day to day timing 
is not as important. Any man who is not already drained of all sexual energy is a "sitting 
duck" for the proficient witch. The time of the year following the spring equinox is the most 
fraught with sexual vigor in a man, and he asserts himself accordingly; but the witch, in turn, 
must work her magic stronger, as she will find his eyes will stray. 

Should the fearful ask, "Is there no defense against such witchery?" it must be answered thus - 
"Yes, there is protection. You must never sleep, never daydream, never be without a vital 
thought, and never have an open mind. Then you shall be protected from the forces of magic." 



THE INGREDIENTS USED 
IN THE PERFORMANCE 
OF SATANIC MAGIC 



C. Imagery 



The adolescent boy who takes great care in carving, on a tree, a heart containing his 
and his love object's initials; the little chap who sits by the hour drawing his conception 
of sleek automobiles; the tiny girl who rocks a scuffed and ragged doll in her arms, and 
thinks of it as her beautiful little baby - these capable witches and warlocks, these 
natural magicians, are employing the magical ingredient known as imagery, and the 
success of any ritual depends on it. 

Children, not knowing or caring if they possess artistic skill or other creative talents, 
pursue their goals through the use of imagery of their own manufacture, whereas "civilized" 
adults are much more critical of their own creative efforts. This is why a "primitive" magician 
can utilize a mud doll or crude drawing to successful advantage in his magical ceremonies. To 
him, the image is as accurate as needs be. 

Anything which serves to intensify the emotions during a ritual will contribute to its success. 
Any drawing, painting, sculpture, writing, photograph, article of clothing, scent, sound, 
music, tableau, or contrived situation that can be incorporated into the ceremony will serve 
the sorcerer well. 



Imagery is a constant reminder, an intellect- saving device, a working substitute for the real 
thing. Imagery can be manipulated, set up, modified, and created, all according to the will of 
the magician, and the very blueprint that is created by imagery becomes the formula which 
leads to reality. 

If you wish to enjoy sexual pleasures with the one of your choice, you must create the 
situation you desire on paper, canvas, by the written word, etc., in as overstated a way as 
possible, as an integral part of the ceremony. 

If you have material desires, you must gaze upon images of them - surround yourself with the 
smells and sounds conducive to them - create a lodestone which will attract the situation or 
thing that you wish! 

To insure the destruction of an enemy, you must destroy them by proxy! They must be shot, 
stabbed, sickened, burned, smashed, drowned, or rent in the most vividly convincing manner! 
It is easy to see why the religions of the right-hand path frown upon the creation of "graven 
images". The imagery used by the sorcerer is a working mechanism for material reality, which 
is totally opposed to esoteric spirituality. 

A Greek gentleman of magical persuasion once wanted a woman who would satisfy his every 
desire, and so obsessed with the unfound object of his dreams was he, that he went about 
constructing such a wonderful creature. His work completed, he fell so convincingly and 
irrevocably in love with the woman he had created that she was no longer stone, but mortal 
flesh, and alive and warm; and so the magus, Pygmalion, received the greatest of magical 



benedictions, and the beautiful Galatea was his.

OF SATANIC MAGIC 

D. Direction 



JSl Onl of the most overlooked ingredients in the working of magic is the accumulation 
^■j^and subsequent direction of force toward an effective end. 

£ Altogether too many would-be witches and warlocks will perform a ritual, and then go 
9 about with tremendous anxiety waiting for the first sign of a successful working. For 
\ all intent and purpose, they might as well get down on their knees and pray, for their 
J very anxiety in waiting for the desired results only nullifies any real chance of success. 
Furthermore, with this attitude, it is doubtful that enough concentrated energy to even 
perform a proper ceremony could be stored up in the first place. 

To dwell upon or constantly complain about the situation upon which your ritual would be 
based only guarantees the weakening of what should be ritualistically directed force, by 
spreading it thin and diluting it. Once the desire has been established strongly enough to 
employ the forces of magic, then every attempt must be made to symbolically give vent to 
these wishes in the performance of the ritual - NOT before or after! 

The purpose of the ritual is to free the magician from thoughts that would consume him, were 
he to dwell upon them constantiy. Contemplation, daydreaming and constant scheming bums 
up emotional energy that could be gathered together in a dynamically usable force; not to 
mention the fact that normal productivity is severely depleted by such consuming anxiety. 

The witch who casts her spells between long waits by the telephone, anticipating her would- 
be lover's call; the destitute warlock who invokes Satan's blessing, then waits on pins and 
needles for the check to arrive; the man, saddened by the injustices wrought upon him, who, 
having cursed his enemy, plods his way, long of face, and furrowed of brow - all are common 
examples of misdirected emotional energy. 

Small wonder that the "white" magician fears retribution after casting an "evil" spell! 
Retribution, to the guilt- ridden sender, would be assured, by their very conscience- stricken

IN THE PERFORMANCE 
OF SATANIC MAGIC 



E. The Balance Factor 



The Balance Factor is an ingredient employed in the practice of ritual magic which 
rapplies to the casting of lust and compassion rituals more than in the throwing of a 
curse. This ingredient is a small, but extremely important one. 

A complete knowledge and awareness of this factor is an ability few witches and 
warlocks ever attain. This is, simply, knowing the proper type of individual and 
situation to work your magic on for the easiest and best results. Knowing one's own 
limitations is a rather odd bit of introspection, it would seem, for a person who should 
be able to perform the impossible; but under many conditions it can make the difference 
between success and failure. 



If, in attempting to attain your goal through either greater or lesser magic, you find yourself 
failing consistently, think about these things: Have you been the victim of a misdirected, over- 
blown ego which has caused you to want something or someone when the chances are 
virtually non-existent? Are you a talentless, tone-deaf individual who is attempting, through 
magic, to receive great acclaim for your unmusical voice? Are you a plain, glamorless witch 
with oversized feet, nose, and ego, combined with an advanced case of acne, who is casting 
love spells to catch a handsome young movie star? Are you a gross, lumpy, lewd- mouthed, 
snaggle-toothed loafer who is desirous of a luscious young stripper? If so, you'd better learn to 
use the balance factor, or else expect to fail consistently! 

To be able to adjust one's wants to one's capabilities is a great talent, and too many people fail 
to realize that if they are unable to attain the maximum, "a half a loaf can be better than 
none". The chronic loser is always the man who, having nothing, if unable to make a million 
dollars, will reject any chance to make fifty thousand with a disgruntied sneer. 

One of the magician's greatest weapons is knowing himself; his talents, abilities, physical 
attractions and detractions, etc., and when, where, and with whom to utilize them! The man 
with nothing to offer, who approaches the man who is successful with grandiose advice and 
promise of great wealth, has the alacrity of the flea climbing up the elephant's leg with the 
intention of rape! 

The aspiring witch who deludes herself into thinking that a powerful enough working will 
always succeed, despite a magical imbalance, is forgetting one essential rule: magic is like 

NATURE ITSELF, AND SUCCESS IN MAGIC REQUIRES WORKING IN HARMONY WITH NATURE, NOT AGAINST IT. 



THE 

SATANIC RITUAL 



A. NOTES WHICH ARE TO BE OBSERVED 
BEFORE BEGINNING RITUAL 

1 . Person performing ritual stands facing the altar and symbol of Baphomet throughout 
ritual, except when other positions are specifically indicated. 

2. If possible, altar should be against west wall. 

3. In rituals performed by one person the role of priest is not required. When more than 
one person is involved in the ceremony, one of them must act as priest. In a private 
ritual the sole performer follows the instructions for the priest. 

4. Whenever the words "Sherrihamforash!'' and "Hail Satan!" are spoken by the person 
acting as priest, the other participants will repeat the words after him. The gong is 
struck following the other participants' response to "Hail Satan!" 

5. Conversing (except within the context of the ceremony) and smoking are prohibited 
after the bell is rung at the beginning, until after it is again rung at the end of the ritual. 

6. The Book of Belial contains the principles of Satanic magic and ritual. Before 
attempting the rituals in the Book of Leviathan, it is imperative that you read and 
understand the complete Book of Belial. Until you have done so, no degree of success 
can be expected from the thirteen steps which follow. 



THE 

SATANIC RITUAL 



B. THE THIRTEEN STEPS 

(See Devices Used in a Satanic Ritual 
for detailed instructions.) 

1 . Dress for ritual. 

2. Assemble devices for ritual; light candles and shut out all outside light sources; place 
parchments to right and left of the altar as indicated. 

3. If a woman is used as the altar she now takes her position - head pointing south, feet 
pointing north. 

4. Purification of the air by ringing of the bell. 

5. "Invocation to Satan" and "Infernal Names" which follow (see Book of Leviathan ) are 
now read aloud by priest. Participants will repeat each Infernal Name after it has been 
said by priest. 

6. Drink from chalice. 

7. Turning counter-clockwise, the priest points with the sword to each cardinal point of 
the compass and calls forth the respective Princes of Hell: Satan from the south, 
Lucifer from the east, Belial from the north, and Leviathan from the west. 

8. Perform benediction with the phallus (if one is used). 

9. Priest reads aloud appropriate invocation for respective ceremony: Lust, Compassion, 
or Destruction (see Book of Leviathan ). 

10. In the case of a personalized ritual this step is extremely important. Solitude is 
compatible with the expressing of the most secret desires, and no attempt to "hold 
back" should be made in the acting out, verbalizing, or casting of images pertaining to 
your desires. It is at this step that your "blueprint" is drawn, wrapped, and sent off to 
the recipient of your working. 



(A) 



To Summon One For Lustful Purpose Or Establish 
A Sexually Gratifying Situation 

Leave the area of the altar and remove yourself to that place, either in the same room 
or without, that will be most conducive to the working of the respective ritual. Then, 
fashion whatever imagery you possibly can that will parallel in as exact a way possible 
the situation towards which you strive. Remember, you have five senses to utilize, so 
do not feel you must limit your imagery to one. Here are devices that may be 
employed (either alone, or in any combination): 

a. graphic imagery such as drawings, paintings, etc. 

b. written imagery such as stories, plays, descriptions of desires and eventual 
outcome of same. 

c. acting out the desire in tableau or playet, either as yourself or portraying the 
role of the object of your desire (transference), using any devices necessary to 
intensify imagery. 

d. any odors relative to the desired person or situation. 

e. any sounds or background noises conducive to a strong image. 

Intense sexual feeling should accompany this step of the ritual, and after sufficient 
imagery is obtained, as strong an orgasm as is possible should serve as climax to this 
step. This climax should be attained using any masturbatory or auto-erotic means 
necessary. After orgasm is obtained, return to the location of the altar and proceed 
with step #11. 

(B) 

To Insure Help Or Success For One Who Has Your 
Sympathy Or Compassion (Including Yourself) 

Remain in close proximity of the altar and with as vivid a mental image as possible of 
the person you wish to help (or intense self-pity), state your desire in your own terms. 
Should your emotions be genuine enough, they will be accompanied the shedding of 
tears, which should be allowed to flow without restraint. After this exercise in 
sentiment is completed, proceed to step #11. 

(C) 

To Cause The Destruction Of An Enemy 

Remain in the area of the altar unless imagery is more easily obtained in another spot, 
such as in the vicinity of the victim. Producing the image of the victim, proceed to 
inflict the destruction upon the effigy in the manner of your choice. This can be done 
in the following ways: 

f. the sticking of pins or nails into a doll representing your victim; the doll may 
be cloth, wax, wood, vegetable matter, etc. 

g. the creation of graphic imagery depicting the method of your victim's 
destruction; drawings, paintings, etc. 



h. the creation of a vivid literary description of your victim's ultimate end. 

i. a detailed soliloquy directed at the intended victim, describing his torments and 
annihilation. 

j . mutilation, injury, infliction of pain or illness by proxy using any other means 
or devices desired. 

Intense, calculated hatred and disdain should accompany this step of the ceremony, 
and no attempt should be made to stop this step until the expended energy results in a 
state of relative exhaustion on the part of the magician. When the exhaustion ensues, 
proceed to step #11. 

1 1 . (a) If requests are written, they are now read aloud by the priest and then burned in the 
flames of the appropriate candle. "Shemhamforash!" and "Hail Satan!" is said after 
each request. 

1 1 . (b) If requests are given verbally, participants (one at a time) now tell them to the 
priest. He then repeats in his own words (those which are most emotionally 
stimulating to him) the request. "Shemhamforash!" and "Hail Satan!" is said after each 
request. 

12. Appropriate Enochian Key is now read by the priest, as evidence of the participants' 
allegiance to the Powers of Darkness. 

13. Ringing of the bell as pollutionary, and then the words "so it is done" are spoken by the 
priest. 



END OF RITUAL 



THE 

SATANIC RITUAL 



C. DEVICES USED IN A SATANIC RITUAL 

CLOTHING 

Black robes are worn by the male participants. The robes may be cowled or hooded, and if 
desired may cover the face. The purpose in covering the face is to allow the participant 
freedom to express emotion in the face, without concern. It also lessens distraction on the part 
of one participant towards another. Female participants wear garments which are sexually 
suggestive; or all black clothing for older women. Amulets bearing the sigil of Baphomet or 
the traditional pentagram of Satan are worn by all participants. 

Robes are donned by men before entering the ritual chamber, and are worn throughout the 
ritual. Men may substitute all black clothing for black robes. 

Black is chosen for the attire in the ritual chamber because it is symbolic of the Powers of 
Darkness. Sexually appealing clothing is worn by women for the purpose of stimulating the 
emotions of the male participants, and thereby intensifying the outpouring of adrenal or bio- 
electrical energy which will insure a more powerful working. 



ALTAR 

Man's earliest altars were living flesh and blood; and man's natural instincts and predilections 
were the foundation on which his religions were based. Later religions, in making man's 
natural inclinations sinful, perverted his living altars into slabs of stone and lumps of metal. 

Satanism is a religion of the flesh, rather than of the spirit; therefore, an altar of flesh is used 
in Satanic ceremonies. The purpose of an altar is to serve as a focal point towards which all 
attention is focused during a ceremony. A nude woman is used as the altar in Satanic rituals 
because woman is the natural passive receptor, and represents the earth mother. 

In some rituals nudity for the woman serving as altar may be impractical, so she may be 
clothed or partially covered. If a female is performing the ritual alone, no woman need be 
used for the altar. If no female is used for the altar, the elevated plane used for her to he upon 
may be used to hold other devices for the ritual. For large group rituals a trapezoidal altar 
about 3 to 4 feet high and 5Vi to 6 feet long can be specially constructed for the woman to he 
upon. If this is impractical, or in private ceremonies, any elevated plane may be used. If a 



woman is used for the altar, the other devices may be placed upon a table within easy reach of 
the priest. 



SYMBOL OF BAPHOMET 

The symbol of Baphomet was used by the Knights Templar to represent Satan. Through the 
ages this symbol has been called by many different names. Among these are: The Goat of 
Mendes, The Goat of a Thousand Young, The Black Goat, The Judas Goat, and perhaps the 
most appropriately, The Scapegoat. 

Baphomet represents the Powers of Darkness combined with the generative fertility of the 
goat. In its "pure" form the pentagram is shown encompassing the figure of a man in the five 
points of the star - three points up, two pointing down - symbolizing man's spiritual nature. In 
Satanism the pentagram is also used, but since Satanism represents the carnal instincts of 
man, or the opposite of spiritual nature, the pentagram is inverted to perfectly accommodate the 
head of the goat - its horns, representing duality, thrust upwards in defiance; the other three 
points inverted, or the trinity denied. The Hebraic figures around the outer circle of the 
symbol which stem from the magical teachings of the Kabala, spell out "Leviathan", the 
serpent of the watery abyss, and identified with Satan. These figures correspond to the five 
points of the inverted star. 

The symbol of Baphomet is placed on the wall above the altar. 



CANDLES 

The candles used in Satanic ritual represent the light of Lucifer - the bearer of light, 
enlightenment, the living flame, burning desire, and the Flames of the Pit. 

Only black and white candles are to be used in Satanic ritual. Never use more than one white 
candle; but as many black candles as are required to iUurninate the ritual chamber may be 
used. At least one black candle is placed to the left of the altar, representing the Powers of 
Darkness and the left-hand path. Other black candles are placed where needed for 
inurnination. One white candle is placed to the right of the altar, representing the hypocrisy of 
white light "magicians" and the followers of the right-hand path. No other light source is to be 
used. 

Black candles are used for power and success for the participants of the ritual, and are used to 
consume the parchments on which blessings requested by the ritual participants are written. 
The white candle is used for destruction of enemies. Parchments upon which curses are 
written are burned in the flame of the white candle. 



BELL 

The shattering effect of the bell is used to mark both the beginning and the end of the ritual. 
The priest rings the bell nine times, turning counter clockwise and directing the tolling 



towards the four cardinal points of the compass. This is done once at the beginning of the 
ritual to clear and purify the air of all external sounds, and once again at the end of the ritual 
to intensify the working and act as a pollutionary indicating finality. 

The tonal quality of the bell used should be loud and penetrating, rather than soft and tinkling. 



CHALICE 

In Satanic ritual the chalice or goblet used represents the Chalice of Ecstasy. Ideally, the 
chalice should be made of silver, but if a silver chalice can not be obtained, one made from 
another metal, glass, or crockery may be used - anything but gold. Gold has always been 
associated with white- light religions and the Heavenly Realm. 

The chalice is to be drunk from first by the priest, then by one assistant. In private rituals the 
person perfonning the ceremony drains the chalice. 



ELIXIR 

The stimulating fluid or Elixir of Life used by the Pagans has been corrupted into sacramental 
wine by the Christian faith. Originally, the liquor used in Pagan rituals was drunk to relax and 
intensify the emotions of those involved in the ceremony. Satanism does not sacrifice its god, 
as do other religions. The Satanist practices no such form of symbolic cannibalism, and 
returns the sacramental wine used by the Christians to its original purpose - that of stimulating 
the emotions necessary to Satanic ritual. Wine itself need not be used - whatever drink is most 
stimulating and pleasing to the palate is in order. 

The Elixir of Life is to be drunk from the Chalice of Ecstasy, as indicated above, immediately 
following the Invocation to Satan. 



SWORD 

The Sword of Power is symbolic of aggressive force, and acts as an extension and intensifier 
of the arm with which the priest uses to gesture and point. A parallel to this is the pointing 
stick or blasting wand used in other forms of magical ritual. 

The sword is held by the priest and is used to point towards the symbol of Baphomet during 
the Invocation to Satan. It is also used, as indicated in Steps of Ritual, when calling forth the 
four Princes of Hell. The priest thrusts the point of the sword through the parchment 
containing the message or request after it has been read aloud; it is then used to hold the 
parchment while introduced into the candle flame. While hearing the requests of other 
participants, and while repeating same, the priest places the sword atop their heads (in 
traditional "knighting" fashion). 

For private rituals, if a sword cannot be obtained, a long knife, cane, or similar staff may be 
used. 



PHALLUS 



The phallus is a Pagan fertility symbol which represents generation, virility, and aggression. 
This is yet another device which has been blasphemously converted to fit the guild-ridden 
ceremonies of Christianity. The phallus is a non- hypocritical version of the aspergillum, or 
"holy water sprinkler'' used in Catholicism - quite a metamorphosis of the common penis! 

The phallus is held in both hands of one of the priest's assistants, and methodically shaken 
twice towards each cardinal point of the compass, for the benediction of the house. 

Any phallic symbol may be used. If none is obtainable one may be made from plaster, wood, 
clay, wax, etc. The phallus is necessary only in organized group rituals. 



GONG 

The gong is used to call upon the forces of Darkness. It is to be struck once after the 
participants have repeated the priest's words, "Hail Satan!". A gong is necessary only in 
organized group rituals. For the best tonal quality a concert gong is preferred, but if one 
cannot be obtained any gong with a full, rich tone may be used. 



PARCHMENT 

Parchment is used because its organic properties are compatible with the elements of nature. 
In keeping with the Satanic views on sacrifice, the parchment used would be made from the 
skin of a sheep which was, by necessity, killed for food. An animal is never slaughtered for 
the purpose of using all or a part of that animal in a Satanic ritual. If commercial parchment 
which has been made from already slaughtered sheep cannot be obtained, plain paper may be 
substituted. 

The parchment is the means by which the written message or request can be consumed by the 
candle flame and sent out into the ether. The request is written on parchment or paper, read 
aloud by the priest, and then burned in the flame of either the black or white candle - 
whichever is appropriate for the particular request. Before the ritual begins curses are placed 
to the right of the priest, and charms or blessings are placed to the left of him. 



(WATER) 



THE BOOK OF LEVIATHAN 

THE RAGING SEA 

Despite all non- verbalists' protests to the contrary, soaring heights of emotional ecstasy or 
raging pangs of anguish can be attained through verbal communication. If the magical 
ceremony is to employ all sensory awarenesses, then the proper sounds must be invoked. It is 
certainly true that "actions speak louder than words", but words become as monuments to 
thoughts. 

Perhaps the most noticeable shortcoming in the printed magical conjurations of the past is the 
lack of emotion developed upon the reciting of them. An old wizard known to the author, who 
was once employing a self- composed invocation of great personal meaning in the light of his 
magical desires, ran out of words just as his ritual was moments short of its successful 
culmination. Aware of the necessity of keeping his emotional response generating, he quickly 
adlibbed the first emotion- provoking words that came to mind - a few stanzas of a poem by 
Rudyard Kipling! Thus, with this final burst of glory- charged adrenalin, was he able to 
finalize an effective working! 

The invocations which follow are designed to serve as proclamations of certainty, not whining 
apprehension. For this reason they are devoid of shallow offerings -up and hollow charities. 
Leviathan, the great Dragon from the Watery Abyss, roars forth as the surging sea, and these 
invocations are his tribunals. 



INVOCATION 
TO 

SATAN 



In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi excelsi! 

In the name of Satan, the Ruler of the earth, the King of the world, I command the forces of 
Darkness to bestow their Infernal power upon me! 

Open wide the gates of Hell and come forth from the abyss to greet me as your brother (sister) 
and friend ! 

Grant me the indulgences of which I speak! 

I have taken thy name as a part of myself! I live as the beasts of the field, rejoicing in the 
fleshly life! I favor the just and curse the rotten! 

By all the Gods of the Pit, I command that these things of which I speak shall come to pass! 
Come forth and answer to your names by manifesting my desires! 



OH HEAR THE NAMES: 



THE INFERNAL NAMES 



The Infernal names are listed here in alphabetical order purely to simplify referral to them. 

When calling the names, all of them may be recited, or a given number of those most 
significant to the respective working may be chosen. 

Whether all or only some of the names are called, they must be taken out of the rigidly 
organized form in which they are listed here and arranged in a phonetically effective roster.

INVOCATION EMPLOYED TOWARDS 
THE CONJURATION OF LUST 

Jml Come forth, Oh great spawn of the abyss and make thy presence manifest. I have set 

^Bjr^my thoughts upon the blazing pinnacle which glows with the chosen lust of the 
W moments of increase and grows fervent in the turgid swell. 

V Send forth that messenger of voluptuous delights, and let these obscene vistas of my 
\ dark desires take form in future deeds and doings. 

From the sixth tower of Satan there shall come a sign which joineth with those saltes 
within, and as such will move the body of the flesh of my summoning. 

I have gathered forth my symbols and prepare my garnishings of the is to be, and the image of 
my creation lurketh as a seething basilisk awaiting his release. 

The vision shall become as reality and through the nourishment that my sacrifice giveth, the 
angles of the first dimension shall become the substance of the third. 

Go out into the void of night (light of day) and pierce that mind that respondeth with thoughts 
which leadeth to paths of lewd abandon. 



(Male) My rod is athrust! The penetrating force of my venom shall shatter the sanctity of 
that mind which is barren of lust; and as the seed falleth, so shall its vapours be 
spread within that reeling brain benumbing it to helplessness according to my 
will! In the name of the great god Pan, may my secret thoughts be marshaled into 
the movements of the flesh of that which I desire! 



Shemhamforash! Hail Satan! 

(Female) My loins are aflame! The dripping of the nectar from my eager cleft shall act as 
pollen to that slumbering brain, and the mind that feels not lust shall on a sudden 
reel with crazed impulse. And when my mighty surge is spent, new wanderings 
shall begin; and that flesh which I desire shall come to me. In the names of the 
great harlot of Babylon, and of Lilith, and of Hecate, may my lust be fulfilled! 



Shemhamforash! 



Hail Satan! 



INVOCATION EMPLOYED TOWARDS 
THE CONJURATION OF DESTRUCTION 

B ehold ! The mighty voices of my vengeance smash the stillness of the air and stand 

^Bfc^as monoliths of wrath upon a plain of writhing seipents. I am become as a monstrous 
W machine of annihilation to the festering fragments of the body of he (she) who would 
£ detain me. 

\ It repenteth me not that my summons doth ride upon the blasting winds which multiply 
J the sting of my bitterness; And great black slimy shapes shall rise from brackish pits 
and vomit forth their pustulence into his (her) puny brain. 

I call upon the messengers of doom to slash with grim delight this victim I hath chosen. Silent 
is that voiceless bird that feeds upon the brain- pulp of him (her) who hath tormented me, and 
the agony of the is to be shall sustain itself in shrieks of pain, only to serve as signals of 
warning to those who would resent my being. 

Oh come forth in the name of Abaddon and destroy him (her) whose name I giveth as a sign. 

Oh great brothers of the night, thou who makest my place of comfort, who rideth out upon the 
hot winds of Hell, who dwelleth in the devil's fane; Move and appear! Present yourselves to 
him (her) who sustaineth the rottenness of the mind that moves the gibbering mouth that 
mocks the just and strong!; rend that gaggling tongue and close his (her) throat, Oh Kali! 
Pierce his (her) lungs with the stings of scorpions, Oh Sekhmet! Plunge his (her) substance 
into the dismal void, Oh mighty Dagon! 

I thrust aloft the bifid barb of Hell and on its tines resplendentiy impaled my sacrifice through 
vengeance rests! 



Shemhamf orash ! 



Hail Satan! 



INVOCATION EMPLOYED TOWARDS 
THE CONJURATION OF COMPASSION 




W,™ the anger of anguish and the wrath of the stifled, I pour forth my voices, 
wrapped in rolling thunder, that you may hear! 

Oh great lurkers in the darkness, oh guardians of the way, oh minions of the might of 
Thoth! Move and appear! Present yourselves to us in your benign power, in behalf of 
one who believes and is stricken with torment. 

Isolate him (her) in the bulwark of your protection, for he (she) is undeserving of 
anguish and desires it not. 

Let that which bears against him (her) be rendered powerless and devoid of substance. 

Succor him (her) through fire and water, earth and air, to regain what he (she) has lost. 

Strengthen with fire the marrow of our friend and companion, our comrade of the Left-Hand 
Path. 

Through the power of Satan let the earth and its pleasures re-enter his (her) being. 

Allow his (her) vital saltes to flow unhampered, that he (she) may savor the carnal nectars of 
his (her) future desires. 

Strike dumb his (her) adversary, formed or formless, that he (she) may emerge joyful and 
strong from that which afflicts him (her). 

Allow no misfortune to allay his (her) path, for he (she) is of us, and therefore to be cherished. 

Restore him (her) to power, to joy, to unending dominion over the reverses that have beset 
him (her). 

Build around and within him (her) the exultant radiance that will herald his (her) emergence 
from the stagnant morass which engulfs him (her). 

This we command, in the name of Satan, whose mercies flourish and whose sustenance will 
prevail! 

As Satan reigns so shall his (her) own whose name is as this sound: (name) is the vessel 
whose flesh is as the earth; life everlasting, world without end! 

Shemhamforash! Hail Satan! 




THE ENOCHIAN LANGUAGE 
AND THE ENOCHIAN KEYS 



ttf The magical language used in Satanic ritual is Enochian, a language thought to be 

^■fefolder than Sanskrit, with a sound grammatical and syntactical bases. It resembles 
W Arabic in some sounds and Hebrew and Latin in others. It first appeared in print in 
£ 1659 in a biography of John Dee, the famous Sixteenth Century seer and court 
9 astrologer. This work, by Meric Casaubon, describes the occultist Dee's activities with 
\ his associate, Edward Kelly, in the art of scrying or crystal gazing. 

Instead of the usual crystal ball, Kelly, who was the gazer, used a many- faceted 
trapezohedron. The "angels" referred to in Kelly's first revelation of the Enochian Keys, 
obtained through the windows of the crystal, are only "angels" because occultists to this day 
have lain ill with metaphysical constipation. Now the crystal clears, and the "angels" are seen 
as "angles" and the windows to the fourth dimension are thrown open - and to the frightened, 
the Gates of Hell. 

I have presented my translation of the following calls with an archaic but Satanically correct 
unvarnishing of the translation employed by the Order of the Golden Dawn in the late 
Nineteenth Century. In Enochian the meaning of the words, combined with the quality of the 
words, unite to create a pattern of sound which can cause tremendous reaction in the 
atmosphere. The barbaric tonal qualities of this language give it a truly magical effect which 
cannot be described. 

For many years the Enochian Keys, or Calls, have been shrouded in secrecy. The few 
printings that have existed completely eliminate the correct wording, as the proper translation 
has been disguised through the use of euphemisms, and only designed to throw the inept 
magician and/or would-be inquisitor off the track. Apocryphal as they have become (and who 
can tell what grim reality provokes the "fantasy"), the Enochian Calls are the Satanic paeans 
of faith. Dispensing with such once- pragmatic whitewashing in terms such as "holy" and 
"angelic", and arbitrarily chosen groups of numbers, the purpose of which were only to act as 
substitutes for "blasphemous" words - here, then, are the true Enochian Calls, as received 
from an unknown hand. 



THE FIRST KEY 



The first Enochian Key represents an initial proclamation from Satan, stating the inception of 
the laws of temporal theologies and of the lasting power which resides in those bold enough 
to recognize earthly beginnings and absolutes.

(English) 

I reign over thee, saith the Lord of the Earth, in power exalted above and below, in whose 
hands the sun is a guttering sword and the moon a through- thrusting fire, who measureth your 
garments in the midst of my vestures, and trusseth you up as the palms of my hands, and 
brighten your vestments with Infernal light. 

I made ye a law to govern the holy ones, and delivered a rod with wisdom supreme. You 
lifted your voices and swore your allegiance to Him that liveth triumphant, whose beginning 
is not, nor end cannot be, which shineth as a flame in the midst of your palaces, and reigneth 
amongst you as the balance of life! 

Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto me, for I 
am the same! - the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell! 

THE SECOND KEY 

In order to pay homage to the very lusts which sustain the continuance of life, itself, The 
Second Enochian Key extends this recognition of our earthly heritage unto a talisman of 
power. 

(Enochian) 

Adagita vau-pa-ahe zodonugonu fa-a-ipe salada! Vi-i-vau el! Sobame ial-pereji i-zoda- 
zodazod pi-adapehe casarema aberameji ta ta-labo paracaleda qo-ta lores- el- qo turebesa ooge

coresa tage o-quo maninu IA-I-DON. Torezodu! gohe-el, zodacare eca ca-no-quoda! 
zodameranu micalazodo od ozadazodame vaurelar; lape zodir IOIAD! 

(English) 

Can the wings of the winds hear your voices of wonder?; O you!, the great spawn of the 
worms of the Earth!, whom the Hell fire frames in the depth of my jaws!, whom I have 
prepared as cups for a wedding or as flowers regaling the chambers of lust! 



Stronger are your feet than the barren stone! Mightier are your voices than the manifold 
winds! For you are become as a building such as is not, save in the mind of the All- Powerful 
manifestation of Satan! 

Arise!, saith the First! Move therefore unto his servants! Show yourselves in power, and make 
me a strong seer- of- things, for I am of Him that liveth forever! 

THE THIRD KEY 

The Third Enochian Key establishes the leadership of the earth upon the hands of those great 
Satanic magicians who throughout the successive ages have held dominion over the peoples 
of the world. 

(Enochian) 

Micama! goho Pe-IAD! zodir com-selahe azodien biabe os-lon-dohe. Norezodacahisa otahila 
Gigipahe; vaunid-el-cahisa ta-pu-ime qo-mos-pelehe telocahe; qui-i-inu toltoregi cahisa i

Yehusozod ca-ca-com, od do-o-a-inu noari micaolazoda a-ai-om. Casarameji gohia: 
Zodacare! Vaunigilaji! od im-ua-mar pugo pelapeli Ananael Qo-a-an. 

(English) 

Behold!, saith Satan, I am a circle on whose hands stand the Twelve Kingdoms. Six are the 
seats of living breath, the rest are as sharp as sickles, or the Horns of Death. Therein the 
creatures of Earth are and are not, except in mine own hands which sleep and shall rise! 

In the first I made ye stewards and placed ye in the Twelve seats of government, giving unto 
every one of you power successively over the Nine true ages of time, so that from the highest 
vessels and the comers of your governments you might work my power, pouring down the 
fires of life and increase continually on the Earth. Thus you are become the skirts of justice 
and truth. In Satan's name, rise up! Show yourselves! Behold!, his mercies flourish, and his 
name is become mighty among us. In whom we say: Move!, Ascend!, and apply yourselves 
unto us as the partakers of His secret wisdom in your creation! 

THE FOURTH KEY 

The Fourth Enochian Key refers to the cycling of the ages of time. 

(Enochian) 

Otahil elasadi babaje, od dorepaha gohol: gi-cahisaje auauago coremepe peda, dasonuf vi- 
vau-di-vau? Casaremi oeli meapeme sobame agi coremepo carep-el: casaremeji caro-o-dazodi 
cahisa od vaugeji; dasata ca-pi-mali cahisa ca-pi-ma-on: od elonusahinu cahisa ta el-o calaa. 
Torezodu nor-quasahi od fe-caosaga: Bagile zodir e-na-IAD: das iod apila! Do-o-a-ipe quo-A- 
AL, zodacare! Zodameranu obelisonugi resat-el aaf nor-mo-lapi! 



(English) 



I have set my feet in the South, and have looked about me, saying: Are not the thunders of 
increase those which reign in the second angle? 

Under whom I have placed those whom none hath yet numbered, but One; in whom the 
second beginnings of things are and wax strong, successively adding the numbers of time, and 
their powers doth stand as the first of the nine! 

Arise!, you sons of pleasure, and visit the Earth; for I am the Lord, your God, which is and 
liveth forever! 

In the name of Satan, Move!, and show yourselves as pleasant deliverers, that you may praise 
Him among the sons of men! 



THE FIFTH KEY 

The Fifth Enochian Key affirms the Satanic placing of traditional priests and wizards upon the 
earth for the purpose of misdirection. 

(Enochian) 

Sapahe zodimii du-i-be, od noasa ta qu-a-nis, adarocahe dorepehal caosagi od faonutas 
peripesol ta-be-liore. Casareme A-me-ipezodi na-zodaretahe afa; od dalugare zodizodope

a-asa: fetahe-ar-ezodi od beliora: ia-ial eda-nasa cicalesa; bagile Ge-iad I- el! 

(English) 

The mighty sounds have entered into the third angle and are become as seedlings of folly, 
smiling with contempt upon the Earth, and dwelling in the brightness of the Heaven as 
continual comforters to the destroyers of self. 

Unto whom I fastened the pillars of gladness, the lords of the righteous, and gave them 
vessels to water the earth with her creatures. They are the brothers of the First and the Second, 
and the beginning of their own seats which are garnished with myriad ever-burning lamps, 
whose numbers are as the First, the ends, and the contents of time! 

Therefore, come ye and obey your creation. Visit us in peace and comfort. Conclude us 
receivers of your mysteries; for why? Our Lord and Master is the All- One! 



THE SIXTH KEY 

The Sixth Enochian Key establishes the structure and form of that which has become the 
Order of the Trapezoid and Church of Satan. 



(Enochian) 



Gahe sa-div cahisa em, micalazoda Pil-zodinu, sobam El haraji mir babalonu od obeloce 
samevelaji, dalagare malapereji ar-caosaji od acame canale, sobola zodare fa-beliareda caosaji 
od cahisa aneta-na miame ta Viv od Da. Daresare Sol-petahe-bienu. Be-ri-ta od zodacame ji- 
mi-calazodo: sob-ha-atahe tarianu luia-he od ecarinu MADA Qu-a-a-on! 

(English) 

The spirits of the fourth angle are Nine, mighty in the trapezoid, whom the first hath formed, a 
torment to the wretched and a garland to the wicked; giving unto them fiery darts to vanne the 
earth, and Nine continual workmen whose courses visit with comfort the Earth, and are in 
government and continuance as the Second and Third. 

Therefore, harken unto my voice! I have talked of you, and I move you in power and 
presence, whose works shall be a song of honor, and the praise of your God in your creation! 



THE SEVENTH KEY 

The Seventh Enochian Key is used to invoke lust, pay homage to glamour, and rejoice in the 
delights of the flesh. 

(Enochian) 

Ra-asa isalamanu para-di-zoda oe-cari-mi aao iala-pire-gahe Qui-inu. Enai butamonu od 
inoasa ni pa-ra-diala. Casaremeji ujeare cahirelanu, od zodonace lucifatianu, caresa ta vavale-

mica-ol-zododa aaiome. Bajirele papenore idalugama elonusahi-od umapelifa vau-ge-ji Bijil - 
IAD! 

(English) 

The East is a house of harlots singing praises among the flames of the first glory wherein the 
Dark Lord hath opened His mouth; and they are become as living dwellings in whom the 
strength of man rejoiceth; and they are appareled with ornaments of brightness, such as work 
wonders on all creatures. Whose kingdoms and continuance are as the Third and Fourth, 
strong towers and places of comfort, the seats of pleasure and continuance. O ye servants of 
pleasure, Move!, Appear!, sing praises unto the Earth and be mighty amongst us. For that to 
this remembrance is given power, and our strength waxeth strong in our comforter. 



THE EIGHTH KEY 

The Eighth Enochian Key refers to the emergence of the Satanic Age. 



(Enochian) 



Bazodemelo i ta pi-ripesonu olanu Na-zodavabebe ox. Casaremeji varanu cahisa vaugeji asa 
berameji balatoha: goho IAD. Soba miame tarianu ta lolacis Abaivoninu od azodiajiere riore.

mamao siasionu, od mabezoda IAD oi asa-momare poilape. NUASA! Zodameranu ciaosi 
caosago od belioresa od coresi ta beramiji. 

(English) 

The midday of the first is as the third indulgence made of hyacinthine pillars, in whom the 
elders are become strong, which I have prepared for mine own justice, saith Satan, whose 
long continuance shall be as bucklers to Leviathan. How many are there which remain in the 
glory of the earth, which are, and shall not see death until the house falls and the dragon doth 
sink? Rejoice!, for the crowns of the temple and the robe of Him that is, was, and shall be 
crowned are no longer divided! Come forth!, Appear 



THE NINTH KEY 

The Ninth Enochian Key warns of the use of substances, devices or pharmaceuticals which 
might lead to the delusion and subsequent enslavement of the master. A protection against 
false values. 

(Enochian) 

Micaoli beranusaji perejela napeta ialapore, das barinu efafaje Pe vaunupeho olani od 
obezoda, soba-ca upaahe cahisa tatanu od tarananu balie, alare busada so-bolunu od cahisa

cahisa pidiai Colalala. Ul ci ninu a sobame ucime. Bajile? IAD BALATOHE cahirelanu pare! 
NIISO! od upe ofafafe; bajile a-cocasahe icoresaka a uniji beliore. 

(English) 

A mighty guard of fire with two-edged swords flaming (which contain the vials of delusion, 
whose wings are of wormwood and of the marrow of salt), have set their feet in the West, and 
are measured with their ministers. These gather up the moss of the Earth, as the rich man doth 
his treasure. Cursed are they whose iniquities they are! In their eyes are millstones greater 
than the Earth, and from their mouths run seas of blood. Their brains are covered with 
diamonds, and upon their heads are marble stones. Happy is he on whom they frown not. For 
Why? The Lord of Righteousness rejoiceth in them! Come away, and leave your vials, for the 
time is such as requireth comfort! 



THE TENTH KEY 



The Tenth Enochian Key creates rampant wrath and produces violence. Dangerous to employ 
unless one has learnt to safeguard his own immunity; a random hghtning bolt! 

(Enochian) 

Coraxo cahisa coremepe, od belanusa Lucala azodiazodore paebe Soba iisononu cahisa 
uirequo ope copehanu od racalire maasi bajile caosagi; das yalaponu dosiji od basajime; od ox

olora jinayo anujelareda. Ohyo! ohyo! noibe Ohyo! caosagonu! Bajile madarida i zodirope 
cahiso darisapa! NIISO! caripe ipe nidali! 

(English) 

The thunders of wrath doth slumber in the North, in the likeness of an oak whose branches are 
dung- filled nests of lamentation and weeping laid up for the Earth, which bum night and day 
and vomit out the heads of scorpions and live sulphur mingled with poison. These be the 
thunders that in an instant roar with a hundred mighty earthquakes and a thousand as many 
surges, which rest not, nor know any time here. One rock bringeth forth a thousand, even as 
the heart of man doth his thoughts. Woe! Woe!, Yea!, woe be to the Earth, for her iniquity is, 
was, and shall be great. Come away! But not your mighty sounds! 

THE ELEVENTH KEY 

The Eleventh Enochian Key is used to herald the coming of the dead and establish a 
sustenance beyond the grave. To bind to the earth. A funerary call. 

(Enochian) 

Oxiayala holado, od zodirome O coraxo das zodiladare raasyo. Od vabezodire cameliaxa od 
bahala: NIISO! salamanu telocahe! Casaremanu hoel-qo, od ti ta zod cahisa soba coremefa i 
ga. NIISA! bagile aberameji nonucape. Zodacare eca od Zodameranu! odo cicale Qaa! 
Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan! 

(English) 

The mighty throne growled and there were five thunders that flew into the East. And the eagle 
spake and cried aloud: Come away from the house of death! And they gathered themselves 
together and became those of whom it measured, and they are the deathless ones who ride the 
whirlwinds. Come away! For I have prepared a place for you. Move therefore, and show 
yourselves! Unveil the mysteries of your creation. Be friendly unto me for I am your God, the 
true worshipper of the flesh that liveth forever! 



THE TWELFTH KEY 



The Twelfth Enochian Key is used to vent one's displeasure towards man's need for misery, 
and bring forth torment and conflict to the harbingers of woe. 

(Enochian) 

Nonuci dasonuf Babaje od cahisa ob hubaio tibibipe? alalare ataraahe od ef ! Dark fafenu 
mianu ar Enayo ovof ! Soba dooainu aai i VONUPEHE. Zodacare, gohusa, od Zodameranu. 
Odo cicale Qaa! Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan! 

(English) 

O ye that range in the South and are the lanterns of sorrow, buckle your armor and visit us! 
Bring forth the legions of the army of Hell, that the Lord of the Abyss may be magnified, 
whose name amongst ye is Wrath! Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your 
creation! Be friendly unto me, for I am the same!, the true worshipper of the highest and 
ineffable King of Hell! 

THE THIRTEENTH KEY 

The Thirteenth Enochian Key is used to make the sterile lustful and vex those who would 
deny the pleasures of sex. 

(Enochian) 

Napeai Babajehe das berinu vax ooaona larinuji vonupehe doalime: conisa olalogi oresaha das 
cahisa afefa. Micama isaro Mada od Lonu-sahi-toxa, das ivaumeda aai Jirosabe. Zodacare od 
Zodameranu. Odo cicale Qaa! Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan! 

(English) 

O ye swords of the South, which have eyes to stir up the wrath of sin, making men drunken 
which are empty; Behold! the promise of Satan and His power, which is called amongst ye a 
bitter sting! Move and appear! Unveil the mysteries of your creation! For I am the servant of 
the same, your God, the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell! 

THE FOURTEENTH KEY 

The Fourteenth Enochian Key is a call for vengeance and the manifestation of justice. 

(Enochian) 

Noroni bajihie pasahasa Oiada! das tarinuta mireca ol tahila dodasa tolahame caosago 
/zomida: das berinu orocahe quare: Micama! Bial! Oiad; aisaro toxa das ivame aai Balatima. 
Zodacare od Zodameranu! Od cicale Qaa! Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe 
Saitan! 



(English) 



O ye sons and daughters of mildewed minds, that sit in judgement of the iniquities wrought 
upon me - Behold! the voice of Satan; the promise of Him who is called amongst ye the 
accuser and supreme tribune! Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your 
creation! Be friendly unto me, for I am the same!, the true worshipper of the highest and 
ineffable King of Hell! 



THE FIFTEENTH KEY 

The Fifteenth Enochian Key is a resolution of acceptance and understanding of the masters 
whose duty lies in administering to the seekers after spiritual gods. 

(Enochian) 

Ilasa! tabaanu li-El pereta, casaremanu upaahi cahisa dareji; das oado caosaji oresacore: das 
omaxa monasaci Baeouibe od emerajisa Iaiadix. Zodacare od Zodameranu! Odo cicale Qaa. 
Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan! 

(English) 

O thou, the governor of the first flame, under whose wings are the spinners of cobwebs that 
weave the Earth with dryness; that knowest the great name "righteousness" and the seal of 
false honor. Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly 
unto me, for I am the same!, the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell! 



THE SIXTEENTH KEY 

The Sixteenth Enochian Key gives recognition of the wondrous contrasts of the earth, and of 
the sustenance of these dichotomies. 

(Enochian) 

Ilasa viviala pereta! Salamanu balata, das acaro odazodi busada, od belioraxa balita: das inusi 
caosaji lusadanu emoda: das ome od taliobe: darilapa iehe ilasa Mada Zodilodarepe. Zodacare 
od Zodameranu. Odo cicale Qaa: zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan! 

(English) 

O thou second flame, the house of justice, which hast thy beginnings in glory and shalt 
comfort the just; which walketh upon the Earth with feet of fire; which understands and 
separates creatures! Great art thou in the God of stretch- forth- and- conquer. Move therefore, 
and appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto me, for I am the same!, the 
true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell! 



THE SEVENTEENTH KEY 



The Seventeenth Enochian Key is used to enlighten the benumbered and destroy through 
revelation. 

(Enochian) 

Ilasa dial pereta! soba vaupaahe cahisa nanuba zodixalayo dodasihe od berinuta f axis a hubaro 
tasataxa yolasa: soba lad i Vonupehe o Uonupehe: aladonu dax ila od toatare! Zodacare od 
Zodameranu! Odo cicale Qaa! Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan! 

(English) 

O thou third flame!, whose wings are thorns to stir up vexation, and who hast myriad living 
lamps going before thee; whose God is wrath in anger - Gird up thy loins and harken! Move 
therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto me, for I am the 
same!, the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell! 



THE EIGHTEENTH KEY 

The Eighteenth Enochian Key opens the gates of Hell and casts up Lucifer and his blessing. 

(Enochian) 

Ilasa micalazoda olapireta ialpereji beliore: das odo Busadire Oiad ouoaresa caosago: 
casaremeji Laiada eranu berinutasa cafafame das ivemeda aqoso adoho Moz, od maoffasa. 
Bolape como belioreta pamebeta. Zodacare od Zodameranu! Odo cicale Qaa. Zodoreje, lape 
zodiredo Noco Mada, hoathahe Saitan! 

(English) 

O thou mighty light and burning flame of comfort!, that unveilest the glory of Satan to the 
center of the Earth; in whom the great secrets of truth have their abiding; that is called in thy 
kingdom: "strength through joy", and is not to be measured. Be thou a window of comfort 
unto me. Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto 
me, for I am the same!, the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell! 

THE NINETEENTH KEY 

The Nineteenth Enochian Key is the great sustainer of the natural balance of the earth, the law 
of thrift, and of the jungle. It lays bare all hypocrisy and the sanctimonious shall become as 
slaves under it. It brings forth the greatest outpouring of wrath upon the miserable, and lays 
the foundation of success for the lover of life. 

(Enochian)

(English) 

O ye pleasures which dwell in the first air, ye are mighty in the parts of the Earth, and execute 
the judgment of the mighty. Unto you it is said: Behold the face of Satan, the beginning of 
comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the stars, which provided you for the government of 
the Earth, and her unspeakable variety; furnishing you a power of understanding to dispose all 
things according to the providence of Him that sitteth on the Infernal Throne, and rose up in 
the Beginning saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts; and let there be division in 
her; the glory of her may be always drunken and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the 
fulfillment of lust; and as an handmaiden, let her serve them. One season, let it confound 
another; and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her numbers, let them 
differ in their qualities; and let there be no creature equal with another. The reasonable 
creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling 
places, let them forget their names. The work of Man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His 
buildings, let them become caves for the beasts of the field! Confound her understanding with 
darkness! For why? it repenteth me that I have made Man. One while let her be known, and 
another while a stranger; because she is in the bed of a harlot, and the dwelling place of 
Lucifer the King. 

Open wide the gates of Hell! The lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you! Govern 
those who govern! Cast down such as fall. Bring forth those that increase, and destroy the 
rotten. No place, let it remain in one number. Add and diminish until the stars be numbered. 
Arise! Move! and appear before the covenant of His mouth, which He hath sworn unto us in 
His justice. Open the mysteries of your creation, and make us partakers of the undefiled 

WISDOM.
