pleasures thus abandon desires abide true essence tao beginning attained oneness heaven attaining oneness became clear earth attaining oneness became peaceful spirit attaining oneness became divine true nature like empty valley attaining oneness became fully productive things attaining oneness became alive emperors nobilities attaining oneness bring peace prosperity world results achieving oneness heaven without clarity would crack earth without peace would quake spirit without divinity would powerless true nature without productivity would result exhaustion life things without life essence would perish emperors without oneness exalt nobility would stumble fall thus honor based humbleness high builds foundation upon low therefore kings nobles call solitude unworthy virtueless reason base honor upon humbleness hence highly honored regard nobles wish self centered think nobly piece jade think lowly others lump stone tao action ones worldly nature reversed true nature gentleness way application tao things world originate manifestation tao manifestation tao form originates nonbeing void great tao superior man heard tao cultivates diligently average man heard tao

valley located lowly position therefore saint humbles serve people leads people putting last sake peoples welfare thus although rules people people feel burden although leads front people people feel threat hence world supports objection contend therefore competition whole world says tao attained great seems unreal indeed great thus seemed unreal real would insignificantly small three treasures hold guard first kindness second simplicity third humbleness kindness one courageous simplicity one generous humbleness one lead provide guidance one abandons kindness yet tries courageous one abandons simplicity yet tries generous one abandons humbleness yet tries lead guidance doomed perish one fights battle kindness shall win one keeps guard kindness shall secure even great nature shall save protect kindness faithful tao cultivator use force good warrior lose temper great conqueror challenge others good leader humble called virtue peace contention also regarded competence make good use effort people regarded achieving harmony nature perfect oneness true nature warfare saying strategy would rather take defensive position make initial offensive move would rather withdraw foot march forward one inch called advance without advancement defeat without arm force fight enemy carry weapons weapons thus need use weapons greater disaster underestimate enemy may cost one lose valuable life therefore two armies engage battle party feels sorrow killing shall win words tao easy understand practice however world neither understand practice words tao subtle truth deeds way tao people understand therefore understand know hence essence tao appears honorable precious thus saint may dress ordinary coarse clothing yet heart gem true essence within one knows people know person enlightenment one pretends know ignorant fault aware know shall fault therefore saint flawless aware truly knows knows hence flawless people respect authority shall great misfortune interfere peoples livelihood despise living detest people therefore people detest authority saint realizes true nature hence distinguish sense selfrespect thus exalt therefore rejects selfdistinguished selfexalted abides selfawareness selfrespect brave daring acts recklessly shall killed brave acts cautiously kindly shall live two one beneficial harmful nature wishes may know reasons thus saint aware subtlety profoundness natures way takes great caution practicing tao nature contend yet easily wins speak yet always responds summon yet things gather contemplate ease yet plans devised perfectly law nature like giant web although sparsely meshed nothing slip people fear death use trying threaten death people value lives break law executed would dare commit criminal act life death beings handled executioner nature substitute nature executioner kill like replacing master carpenter chop wood one substitutes master carpenter chop wood rarely hurt hands people starved ruler taxed heavily people difficult ruled ruler governs personal desire establishes many laws confuse people therefore people difficult ruled people take death lightly ruler pursues luxurious life depletes people therefore people take death lightly one value life selfdesire truly cherishes life man alive soft supple dies body becomes hard stiff plant alive soft flexible dead becomes dry brittle therefore hard rigid shall lead death soft gentle shall lead life thus strong army rigid force shall win thick big tree cut use big strong take inferior position soft gentle take superior position tao nature like

master nation bear misfortune nation said ruler world truthful words may seem reverse worldly practices great resentment resulted even one tries reconcile make peace bound leave remaining resentment thus considered good settlement therefore saint cultivates introspection selfdiscipline without blaming others faults like ancient custom acts holding left part tally debtor demands nothing others hence person virtue acts debtor person without virtue acts creditor demands others tao nature impersonal makes exception anyone always assists kind virtuous ideal nation small people although abundant weapons need use let people cherish life pursue fame wealth intention move faraway places although boats carriages one ride although weapons armors occasion display let people return ancient simple life knotting ropes used record every event people would enjoy simple food simple clothing contented simple life shall live happily traditional customs neighbors nations overlook one another near
