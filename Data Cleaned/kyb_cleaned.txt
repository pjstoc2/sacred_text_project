outward manifestations appearances know terms material universe phenomena life matter energy short apparent material senses spirit unknowable undefinable may considered thought universal infinite living mind also explains phenomenal world universe simply mental creation subject laws created things universe whole parts units existence mind mind live move principle establishing mental nature universe easily explains varied mental psychic phenomena occupy large portion public attention without explanation nonunderstandable defy scientific treatment understanding great hermetic principle mentalism enables individual readily grasp laws mental universe apply wellbeing advancement hermetic student enabled apply intelligently great mental laws instead using haphazard manner masterkey possession student may unlock many doors mental psychic temple knowledge enter freely intelligently principle explains true nature energy power matter subordinate mastery mind one old hermetic masters wrote long ages ago grasps truth mental nature universe well advanced path mastery words true today time first written without masterkey mastery impossible student knocks vain many doors temple 2 principle correspondence abovethe kybalion principle embodies truth always correspondence laws phenomena various planes life old hermetic axiom ran words grasping principle gives one means solving many dark paradox hidden secret nature planes beyond knowing apply principle correspondence able understand much would otherwise unknowable us principle universal application manifestation various

intelligently known unknown studying monad understands archangel 3 principle vibration nothing rests everything moves everything vibratesthe kybalion principle embodies truth everything motion everything vibrates nothing rest facts modern science endorses new scientific discovery tends verify yet hermetic principle enunciated thousands years ago masters ancient egypt principle explains differences different manifestations matter energy mind even spirit result largely varying rates vibration pure spirit grossest form matter vibrationthe higher vibration higher position scale vibration spirit infinite rate intensity rapidity practically restjust rapidly moving wheel seems motionless end scale gross forms matter whose vibrations low seem rest poles millions upon millions varying degrees vibration corpuscle electron atom molecule worlds universes everything vibratory motion also true planes energy force varying degrees vibration also mental planes whose states depend upon vibrations even spiritual planes understanding principle appropriate formulas enables hermetic students control mental vibrations well others masters also apply principle conquering natural phenomena various ways understands principle vibration grasped scepter power says one old writers 4 principle polarity everything dual everything poles everything pair opposites like unlike opposites identical nature different degree extremes meet truths halftruths paradoxes may reconciledthe kybalion principle embodies truth everything dual everything two poles everything pair opposites old hermetic axioms explains old paradoxes perplexed many stated follows thesis antithesis identical nature different degree opposites differing degree pairs opposites may reconciled extremes meet everything isnt time truths halftruths every truth halffalse two sides everything etc etc etc explains everything two poles opposite aspects opposites really two extremes thing many varying degrees illustrate heat cold although opposites really thing differences consisting merely degrees thing look thermometer see discover heat terminates cold begins thing absolute heat absolute coldthe two terms heat cold simply indicate varying degrees thing thing manifests heat cold merely form variety rate vibration heat cold simply two poles call heatand phenomena attendant thereupon manifestations principle polarity principle manifests case light darkness thing difference consisting varying degrees two poles phenomena darkness leave light begin difference large small hard soft black white sharp dull noise quiet high low positive negative principle polarity explains paradoxes principle supersede principle operates mental plane let us take radical extreme examplethat love hate two mental states apparently totally different yet degrees hate degrees love middle point use terms like dislike shade gradually sometimes loss know whether like dislike neither simply degrees thing see think moment considered importance hermetists possible change vibrations hate vibrations love ones mind minds others many read lines personal experiences involuntary rapid transition love hate reverse case others therefore realize possibility accomplished use means hermetic formulas good evil poles thing hermetist understands art transmuting evil good means application principle polarity short art polarization becomes phase mental alchemy known practiced ancient modern hermetic masters understanding principle enable one change polarity well others devote time study necessary master art 5

counteracting neutralizing using form important part hermetic mental alchemy 6 principle cause effect every cause effect every effect cause everything happens according law chance name law recognized many planes causation nothing escapes lawthe kybalion principle embodies fact cause every effect effect every cause explains everything happens according law nothing ever merely happens thing chance various planes cause effect higher dominating lower planes still nothing ever entirely escapes law hermetists understand art methods rising ordinary plane cause effect certain degree mentally rising higher plane become causers instead effects masses people carried along obedient environment wills desires others stronger heredity suggestion outward causes moving like pawns chessboard life masters

fixing attention upon desirable state directs attention attention changes vibration cultivate art attention means solved secret mastery moods mental states destroy undesirable rate mental vibration put operation principle polarity concentrate upon opposite pole desire suppress kill undesirable changing polaritythe kybalion one important hermetic formulas based upon true scientific principles shown mental state opposite merely two poles one thing mental transmutation polarity might reversed principle known modern psychologists apply breaking undesirable habits bidding students concentrate upon opposite quality possessed fear waste time trying kill fear instead cultivate quality courage fear disappear writers expressed idea forcibly using illustration dark room shovel sweep darkness merely opening shutters letting light darkness disappeared kill negative quality concentrate upon positive pole quality vibrations gradually change negative positive finally become polarized positive
